            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Clergie was in great thraldome, and by the Popes lawes ſo bound and fettered, as ſlaues in the Turkes gallies, that they durſt not ſo much as mutter a word againſt his vſurpations, encrochments, and most mercileſſe cruelties; ſo as his power was onely oppoſed, and his proceedings hindred by our owne lawes, as may be ſeene in the booke intituled, <hi>de iure Regis Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtico,</hi> ſet out by that moſt learned and iudicious in the lawes of England, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Knight.</p>
            <p>As therefore, I vnderſtanding hereby, the excellency of theſe our lawes, and how forcible they haue euer been againſt Antichriſtian tyrannie, not only to ſhake off that heauie yoke of cruell bondage, both from off the Church, and common-wealth; but alſo ſtill to maintaine the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of Soueraigne authority, and the laudable cuſtomes and liberties of our Church, againſt all vniuſt innouations, and vſurpations: I could not (next after the higheſt honour to Gods law, to his Church, and to ſome ſuch worthie of honour, as be in the chiefeſt places of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie therein), but doe this duty of honour vnto you, my Lords the Iudges, and the worthie Societies, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in, and about ſuch lawes, as (next to the law of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

            <p>But here, it may be, it will be ſaid, as ſome vnaduiſed perhaps haue already ſaid, that this book of the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on little concerneth you, and therefore that this my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will not bee ſo acceptable to you, as I wiſh it might be, and indeed as I deſire to haue it.

And that you may ſee, what may truly, and without breach of charity, bee thought of theſe, I<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ro.

His affirmation was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conformity to the Oath of alleagianed, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formall ſatisfactions of the State, concurring with a reſolution to continue in Poperie, is farre more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the State, then open and profest Recuſancie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay it againe (ſaith hee), A follow which hath taken the oath of allegiance; <hi>firſt,</hi> either by power of ſome popiſh diſpenſation, which great men eſpecially may eaſily procure, becauſe by their wit, or worth, or high roome, they may be more horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſeruiceable to the Church of Rome; or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> by proportionable deduction of ſome war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to their conſciences in that caſe, from that briefe of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> in the Queenes time, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="tcp:1694:11"/> before, which any vnderſtanding Papiſt will eaſily apprehend: or <hi>thirdly,</hi> by the couſoning art of mentall reſeruation, of which (perhaps) ſome of their Prieſts and cunninger ſort, eſpecially of the equiuocating generation, will bee ready to make aduantage of; or <hi>fourthly,</hi> by reaſon of wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcience, euen directly and groſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corrupt notions and inſtructions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which is much incident to the more ignorant &amp; inferior rank of Papiſts, who through baſeneſſe and lowneſſe of ſtate, are exempted from intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Conſiſtorie of Rome, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the liberty of many popiſh reſolutions in ſuch caſes; and hauing no grounded and reall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of ſaluation in that profeſſion, (which is an inſeparable miſerie to popiſh hereſie), dare not hazard their temporall happineſſe, for any hope of future comfort they are euer like to haue, or reape by ſuch a miſerable religion: I ſay, a fellow hauing thus taken the oath of allegiance, either by popiſh diſpenſation, mentall reſeruation, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and groſly againſt the checke and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his popiſh conſcience, is by accident, and by conſequent, farre more peſtilentiall to the State, then he was before, for ſuch reaſons as theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this formall outward falſe hearted-conformitie,</hi> Firſt, he diuerts and declines the watchfull eye of ſtate-iealouſie, from ordinary excubation and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie ouer his popiſh villanies and machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; from a more narrow particular inſinuation into his vnder-ground vaults, and timely obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his engroſſing too much gun-powder; and
<pb facs="tcp:1694:12"/> ſo, workes a great deale of miſchiefe vnobſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; fearfully vndermines, without any countermine of policie; and concurres moſt dangerouſly with the outraged malice of that <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> for the waſting of our Church, and diſ-ſtrengthening the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te, without ſenſe or ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is vnworthily armed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reputation of a good ſubiect; and ſo may more boyſterouſly, and with greater brauery, wound and weaken the better ſide; vexe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and good men, more boldly without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment; and ſecretly promote Poperie, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceedings againſt Papiſts, euen with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſome colourable oſtentations of ſafer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and flouriſhing pretences of deeper reaches into the myſteries of State.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee may thereby giue deeper wounds into the heart of the truth, through the ſides of thoſe they call Puritans; and ouer their heads doe his worſt to knocke out the braines of the bleſſed Goſpell of the Sonne of God. It is incredible, what a world of wrong and miſchiefe is wrought vpon the truth which we profeſſe, and true profeſſours thereof, by politicke conformable Papiſts, vpon the wofull aduantage of certaine Miniſters incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie. If ſuch a fellow ſpie out a conſcionable painfull Miniſter, and finde him obnoxious to the rigour of the law, but in the leaſt point; and that (perhaps) out of a peacefull tenderneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, while himſelfe is in heart a ranke traitor to the State: O then he plies the aduantage with much malice and bitterneſſe, by informations, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauations,
<pb facs="tcp:1694:12"/> exaſperations, fawning concurrence with Eccleſiaſticall Courts, vntill hee haue procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the putting out of that burning and ſhining lampe, (for he well knowes, when ſuch lights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the noyſome ſnuffe of Poperie is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to infect that darkſome place): and God knowes, all this is done, not for preſeruation of peace, as he publikely pretends; but for promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of poperie, which he ſecretly intends. I would to God, the reuerend Biſhops and Fathers of our Church, would wiſely thinke of this point, before it be too late. I ſpeake not heere any thing to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Separatiſt, or any truly tumultuous; but to point out a dangerous depth of the <hi>mysterie of iniquitie,</hi> which worketh peſtilently vpon ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages. I rather pray, that all the bleſſings of the God of peace, both in this world, and in the world to come, may be heaped vpon his head, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, which doth any way (with holineſſe and good conſcience) labour to further the peace of our too much diſtracted Sion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he that conformes, in outward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the State, by warrant of popiſh diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt labour to recompence the Popes liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that kind, with ſome more remarkable and notorious ſeruice to the See of Rome. Hee ſhall find himſelfe, out of a ſenſe of ſuch extraordinary fauour from that vnholy Father, bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ingaged in congruitie, to be more ready &amp; reſolute vpon occaſion or aduantage, vpon any deſperate aduenture and high attempt, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his triple infernall crowne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1694:13"/>
            <p>Fifthly, hee that with wilfull inlargement of conſcience, and ſecret ſturdie reſolution, takes the oath, will eaſily and naturally grow reuengefully inraged againſt the righteous Torturers, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of his corrupt and exorbitant conſcience.</p>
            <p>The conſcience receiuing a ſting, tranſfuſeth the ſmart into the affections. Which when they feele, they are preſently furiouſly inraged againſt the occaſioners of that their bitter miſerie. And therefore I am perſwaded, ſuch a fellow, ſo taking the Oath, howſoeuer he may beare himſelfe reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly, is afterwards tranſported, with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and implacable ſpite, againſt the power of that truth, and patrons of that profeſſion, (a ſacred zeale where of hath iuſtly brought a racke and vexation vpon his miſguided conſcience), then he was before. And aſſuredly, if the times ſhould turne, (which God forbid) wee ſhould finde the Church-Papiſt, and the politicke conformable <hi>Pſendo-Catholicke,</hi> more mercileſſe and blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie againſt vs, then the Recuſant. Though the beſt of them, no doubt, at that day, would bee as a brier, and ſharper then a thornie hedge; nay euen as a woolfe in the euening. For there is no malice neere vnto the malice of Poperie, faue the malice of hell.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe grounds alſo, I haue thought, that as the ſtate of a Church-Papiſt, obſtinated in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, is moſt damnable in it ſelfe, (euen the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctours themſelues being witneſſes), as I haue proued elſewhere: (ſee my book of legall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, p. 59.) ſo it is moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous to the State.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1694:13"/>
            <p>I ſpeake not this to driue or deteine any Papiſt from the Church; for I pronounce vnto him, out of the word of life and truth, hee muſt flie out of Babylon, into Sion, if euer hee will ſaue his ſoule: but to let him know, that comming to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, he ought with humility, reuerence, and prayer, to ſubmit his vnderſtanding to illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with truth, and his heart to ſanctification with grace, both for the procurement and comfort of his owne ſaluation, and the contentment and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the State. Otherwiſe, as his dangerouſneſſe to the State is euident and extraordinary: ſo his owne damnation ſleepeth not. For, if poperie were truth, as it is not, but the very doctrine of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels; yet his ſtate is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable, becauſe he ſhould ſo, denie Chriſt before men: if it be falſe, as indeed it is, and moſt accurſed from heauen, then hee iuſtly periſheth in his hereſie.</p>
            <p>But, it may be, ſome will here reply; what can poſſibly be more required, and exacted from theſe men, then conformity in outward obedience to the State? what better ſecurity, or ſurer bond, can be thought vpon, then an oath, the ſacred and ſoueraigne inſtrument of all iuſtice and obedience amongſt men? what further inuention of State, ſhall be able to ſtay the fearfull miſchiefes, that hang hourely ouer our heads, from this malicious and murtherous generation?</p>
            <p>I anſwere, none in the world, while they ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs: not the moſt exquiſite and quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall policie of all the wiſeſt Sates, that lie vnder the face of the Sunne, can affoord helpe in this
<pb facs="tcp:1694:14"/> caſe. Idolatry is euer attended with this inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curſe, that it will plague the kingdome that nouriſheth it, and pay it home at length with a witneſſe, except ſome right round, and reſolute courſe be taken in the meane time, for the rooting of it out. And indeed the depthes of the myſterie of iniquitie are ſo vnfathomable, that they cannot bee ſounded by the plummet of any honeſt and Chriſtian policie, without diuing into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell.</p>
            <p>It is a right iuſt and holy thing, to giue them the oath, and to bring them to the Church. But their violations of oathes, diſpenſations, equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, mentall euaſions, corruptions of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and execrable tranſgreſſions of all lawes, both of God and man, of nations and nature, are ſo infinite and endleſſe; and they ſo mingle their concluſions of Sate, with the very confuſions of hell; that it is euen in proportion as eaſie, to chaine vp thoſe damned ſpirits, from tempting men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; as to bridle thoſe blood-thirſtie mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, from vndermining and ouerturning thoſe States, which profeſſe the truth of Chriſt, if power and meanes were anſwerable to their malice and reuengefull humours.</p>
            <p>It was a royall prouidence of our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, in his firſt ſpeech in the parliament, to admoniſh the Papiſts, that they would not ſo far preſume vpon his lenitie, as thereupon to thinke it lawfull for them, daily to encreaſe their number and ſtrength in this kingdome: whereby, if not in his time, yet at leaſt in time of his poſterity, they
<pb facs="tcp:1694:14"/> might bee in hope to erect their religion againe. But it is more then manifeſt, by daily and wofull experience, that their maine end, all their plots, practiſes, ſtrange inſolencies, &amp; the whole ſphere of a world of Papiſts, that ſwarm amongſt vs, hold a ſtrong oppoſition and counter-motion to that gracious counſell and firſt motion of his Maieſty. A bleſſed and happy thing had it been, had his Princely pleaſure been followed in that point. For aſſuredly, were we rid of the Papiſts; and were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry baniſhed out of the kingdome, as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and policy, reaſon, and religion, it ought: the King and his poſterity, by the mercies of God, might ſit vpon the throne of England, as faſt as the ſtrong and mighty mountaines vpon their ſure foundations. Oh, then would the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine mint and forge of popiſh miſchiefe, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and expire. Ieſuites, the diuels Iourneymen, would take breath, from hammering any more, their helliſh powder-plots in haſt. That malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and murthering generation would grow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartened and vnſpirited, for matter of proiect, and conſpiracie, againſt this noble Sate. The royall perſon of the King would haue none about it, but Angels, and good ſubiects. The concurrent furie of the greateſt enemies in the world, durſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a thought of inuaſion, or ſtirre a finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vnconquerable glory of our peace. For certainly, the crowne of this kingdome is incircled and ſurrounded with ſuch infinite and endleſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of popiſh inſidiations; and ſtands farre more liable to the furious thirſt of forraine ambitions,
<pb facs="tcp:1694:15"/> vpon this ground principally; becauſe they hope, when time ſerues, to finde amongſt vs, a ſide and faction of Papiſts, to ſerue their tume. Cut the thred of this hope; and cut the throat of all plots againſt the Kings perſon; and cruſh the Popes heart, for any probability, or poſſibility, of euer re-eſtabliſhing, and erecting his accurſed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, in this Iland againe.</p>
            <p>Now this bleſſed buſineſſe of moſt important and higheſt conſequence, for the pleaſing of God, ſecurity of the State, and preſeruation of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and royall ſeed, that now ſits with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable glory vpon the throne, would bee happily furthered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if lawes worthily prouided in ſuch caſes, might haue their courſe and current, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, diuerſion, partiality, interception by falſe friends, or any cunning defraudations and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy intentions thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if on our ſide there were but halfe the care and conſcience, for the maintenance of Chriſts truth, and extirpation of the infectious he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of the man of ſinne, which are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both with ſaluation of mens ſoules, and the ſafety of imperiall Crownes: as there is curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cruelty, in popiſh kingdomes, for the continuance of Antichriſtianiſme; and, by a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inquiſition into the very thoughts of men, (the greateſt ſlauerie that euer the ſunne, or the world taſted), for the baniſhing and barring out, euen of all poſſibility, (ſo far as in them lies) of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, plantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of primatiue truth, &amp; profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1694:15"/>
            <p>Thirdly, and aboue all, the plantation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a conſcionable learned miniſtery, muſt doe the deed, when all is done, and ſtrike the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and irreuocable blow into the heart of the Pope, if the neuer-erring Spirit of God haue told vs the truth, 2. Theſſ. 2. 8. The Lord will conſume the wicked man, with the ſpirit of his mouth. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, State, wiſedome, confederations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an States, inuention and execution of good lawes, the diſarming and diſabling of the Popes vaſſals, and the like are very notable and needfull meanes, glorious attendants, and aſſiſtants vnto this holy worke. But the ſword of the Spirit, managed by the hand of a powerfull miniſtery, muſt ſtrike off <hi>Holoſernes</hi> head; and knocke out the braines of that great <hi>Goliah</hi> of Rome, which with intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie doth reuile the hoſt of the liuing God, and trample vpon the neckes of the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The champions of Chriſt, in the battell of the great day of God Almighty, at Armaged don, may beare themſelues brauely, and triumphantly: but the ſpirit of the mouth of the Lord Ieſus, ſhall carry away the chiefeſt glory of the day, in that conqueſt and confuſion of Antichriſt, and in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his triple crowne in the duſt.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time, (vntill the Lord put to his helping hand, for ſetting thoſe means on foot, with reſolution and conſtancie) it is a matter of prodigious amaſement, to conſider, how mightily impunity of popiſh idolatry prouokes the wrath of God againſt vs, &amp; in what danger we ſtand; the State, the Goſpell, the royall perſon of the King,
<pb facs="tcp:1694:16"/> the daily inualuable hope of the ſucceſſion of his children, and particular welfare of euery loyall ſubiect in the Land. For, if any man be ſo void of braine, to doe himſelfe and the State that wrong, as to thinke that there are not ſtill new miſchiefes on foote, and ſecret workings againſt vs ſtill, by powder-plots, Pariſian Maſſacres, or ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable vilanies: let him thinke there is no diuell in hell, no Pope at Rome, no malice in the heart of a Ieſuite.</p>
            <p>Me thinks, it is an aſtoniſhment beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of nature, reaſon, religion, policies of State; that ſuch an intolerable generation, ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to heauen and earth, with abominable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie; ſo viſibly infamous, both to this, and the other world, with many capitall characters of blood; ſo endleſſe and implacable, in their rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſignments, againſt the crowned Maieſty of the Kings Throne; ſo prodigious in their plots, that they haue caſt an inexpiable and euerlaſting aſperſion, vpon the innocency of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuch furious Aſſaſins and Incendiaries, for murthering of Princes, butchery of people, and fiering of Sates; ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raged, euen like Wolues in the euening, to ſwallow vs vp quicke (if the time did ſerue); I ſay, that ſuch, in ſo orthodoxe a Church, and noble a State, ſhould by allowance, toleration, conniuencie, or remiſſneſſe, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticall diſtemper of the arme of iuſtice, or ſome thing, be ſuffered to receiue encreaſement, and multiplication, both in number, and inſolencie, to the great diſhonour of God Almighty, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb facs="tcp:1694:16"/> vexation of Gods people and good ſubiects, and the moſt certaine hazard of the whole State, and the peacefull ſucceſſion of the Kings poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It would neuer bee, but that the Lord in his iuſt indignation, intends, and prepares vs for ſome dreadfull iudgement. And I am afraid, Papiſts will bee the men, to execute Gods heauie wrath vpon vs: becauſe they are a principall matter in the meane time, of high offence againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty.</p>
            <p>To let paſſe infinite more of very ſpeciall, and materiall ponderations, to this purpoſe; conſider, I pray you, but this one point, with feeling appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, which is able to inflame the heart of an ingenuous Heathen with extraordinary indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am perſwaded, there was not a Papiſt in this land, whatſoeuer may be pretended, or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the contrary, but did heartily reioyce, at the taking away of that thrice, nay thouſand times noble and bleſſed Prince, of ſweeteſt memorie, for which the heart of euery true ſubiect, did ſhead moſt worthily, euen teares of blood. Now, what a rufull caſe is this, that ſuch vipers ſhould bee nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the bowels and boſome of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the breath, heart, and life whereof, they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh, and would reioyce to haue extinguiſhed? To conclude the whole point for the preſent: it is the generall ioynt conſent, and current concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Chriſtian orthodox reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vpon the face of Europe; and it is worthily, and vnanſwerably demonſtrated by our gracious Soueraigne, that the Pope is Antichriſt; and
<pb facs="tcp:1694:17"/> Rome, myſticall Babylon. Some particular men, (out of curioſity and conceit of their owne wit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſingularity, doting addictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to popiſh writers, want of further illumination in the point, partiall inclinations towards the diuinity of Rome, or the like), may diſſent, without preiudice of a truth, ſo vniuerſally reſolued vpon, by Diuines of beſt learning, and ſincereſt iudgement. If ſo; then tell me the meaning of ſuch places as theſe, and to whom the ſpirit of God directs the edge and execution thereof.</p>
            <p>Reward her euen as ſhee hath rewarded you, and giue her double, according to her works: and in the cup that ſhe hath filled you, fill her the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Reu. 18. 6.</p>
            <p>And the ten hornes, which thou ſaweſt vpon the beaſt, are they that ſhall hate the whore, and ſhall make her deſolate, and naked, and ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire, Reuel. 17. 16. This prediction, by the iudgement of the beſt diuines, hath the power, and paſſeth into the nature of a precept, and therefore is charged as a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon thoſe of whom it is ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and the like, doe indeed ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and make good thoſe three propoſitions of that learned man, and excellent light of <hi>Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi> in his booke <hi>de iure regum,</hi> pag. 6. &amp; ſequ. The ſumme whereof may bee contriued into this concluſion: Princes and Magiſtrates, with their ſwords and ſcepters; Preachers, by the word and writings; priuate men, by prayer, and all lawfull oppoſition, ought to doe their beſt and vtmoſt, to
<pb facs="tcp:1694:17"/> bring confuſion vpon that <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed doctrine. And thus to follow the counſell of the bleſſed Spirit, in rooting out the limbes of Antichriſt, and Antichriſtianiſme, is ſo farre from being perſecution, that it is a very glorious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto the Maieſty of the God of heauen. The neglect whereof, and impunity of Idolatry is able in ſhort time, to ſhake the pillers, and diſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the ſinewes, to decrowne the head, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the raigne of the ſtrongeſt State, and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prince in the world. Delayes are dangerous; policy to the contrary is pernicious; and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie, cruelty; in ſuch places where theſe ſayings haue place, <hi>bleſſed ſhall he be, that taketh and daſheth her children againſt the ſtones, Pſal. 137. 9. All yee that bend the bow, ſhoot at her, ſpare no arrowes: for ſhe hath ſinned againſt the Lord, Ier. 50. 14. In as much as ſhe glorified her ſelfe, and liued in pleaſure, ſo much giue you to her, torment and ſorrow, Reuel.</hi> 18. 7.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, vntill the holy Spirits coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and commandement to this purpoſe, be taken to heart, and throughly put in execution, I pray the Lord to ſtay their rageful malice, and to turne their popiſh murtherous hearts, from whetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſwords, to ſhead the blood of the Lords annoynted: or elſe, to returne the ſharpeſt ſwords from the poynt, with a cutting edge on both ſides, in vp to the very hilts, in their owne hearts blood. And in deſpite of hell and Rome, good Lord, wee pray thee, let King <hi>Iames</hi> flouriſh ſtill, with a crowne of glory on his head, and a ſcepter of triumph in his hand; and ſtill waſh his Princely
<pb facs="tcp:1694:18"/> feete in the blood of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to preface at this time, from this place, for the diſcharge of my owne conſcience, and the needfull refreſhing your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, with the apprehenſion of thoſe dreadfull dangers, which howerly hang ouer our heads, by reaſon of the impunity of popiſh Idolatry, and the endleſſe ineuitable malice and machinations of the Papiſts. We haue had prouocations, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings enough; from this place, from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe: from heauen, by Gods meſſengers; from hell by the powder-plot; from Rome, by the roring of their Buls; from France, by their maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and butcherie of their Kings: by more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, and politicke; by immediate and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reuelations, diſcoueries, deliuerances: by a blacke and bloody catalogue of moſt hatefull and prodigious conſpiracies, which runne parallell with the golden fine of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> life; by the daily villanous libels of the ſwaggering run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agates of our countrey; baſe and illiterate pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, ſtuft with ribaldrie, and railings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſlanders, impudencies, out-facings, vtterly without any paſſage or impreſſions of grace, or gracious ſpirit. A thouſand times, a thouſand waies. And yet what good haue they done, ſith nothing will ſerue the turne? Gods will muſt bee done. For mine owne part, I haue deliuered mine owne ſoule. If any will not take warning, whom it concernes, his blood be vpon his owne head.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed is he, who fore-ſees the ſtorme, and hides himſelfe in the meane time, vnder the wings
<pb facs="tcp:1694:18"/> of Chriſt, and ſhelter of a good conſcience. With which Concluſion as hee ended, I alſo conclude, commending this pithie ſpeech of my ſo learned a friend, to your wiſedome and godly conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your ſelues to Gods holy protection, and all your iuſt proceedings to his gracious bleſſing; that you may confidently looke for a reward of your well doing in the end of your dayes.</p>

The Church ſhall floriſh more
<pb facs="tcp:1694:20"/> and more: but the enemies power ſhall be diminiſhed. Wrath is vpon them, though they ſee it not. For this is the time of the pouring foorth of the vials, the laſt plagues of God, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtate; and they are<note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> to be poured out, by ſuch inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the true Church, as God ſhall raiſe vp. And though I cannot conceit, that this prophecie pointeth at any one particular kingdome, or perſon, to ſay, this is the man, this is the Countrey, that ſhall ſacke Rome: yet when we ſee what hath already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out, according to things foretold, and by whom the Lord hath effected the ſame, wee ought to giue glorie to God, and alſo acknowledge thoſe his inſtruments raiſed vp, either in other places, or here among our ſelues, to do his will; and by former acts of God done by any of our Nation, wee may (and not without reaſon) coniecture, what may after be effected by vs, the prophecie it ſelfe ſpeaking rather for, then any way againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>The deſtruction of the Popedome muſt be by degrees, and the ſame effected by the power of God in vs of the reformed Churches. For the Angels that muſt plague that earthly ſtate, come out of the Temple, the type of the true Church, as is cleere by the prophecie it ſelfe. Theſe,<note place="margin">Chap. 15. 6. and 16. 1.</note> all of them, are commanded to poure out their plagues vpon the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is the generall tearme giuen to ſet out that worldly and Antichriſtian ſtate. Which commandement they fulfill, and execute the decree of God vpon the ſeuerall parts thereof, one after another. As <hi>firſt,</hi> vpon the <hi>Earth</hi> of that Earthly ſtate. And in this worke, the Lord employed, as in Bohemia, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, others; ſo ſpecially in this our Realme, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Iehu,</hi> the renowned King, <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, who tooke away the lands and poſſeſsions here, from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:1694:20"/> Locuſts, diſſoluing Abbeyes, and Moneſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſending that helliſh rabble packing home againe to their grandſire the Pope, that king of the Locuſts. Then in the <hi>next place,</hi> wrath is poured out vpon the <hi>Sea</hi> of that Earthly ſtate, which is the Eccleſiaſticall part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, touching the idolatrous ſeruice, and worſhip of that man of ſinne. And in this thing, the Lord vſed (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt not here Gods worke by men in other places) that our bleſſed <hi>Ioſias,</hi> the noble Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, renouncing that falſe ſeruice and idolatrous worſhip, establiſhing Gods true worſhip among vs. In the <hi>third place,</hi> is the viall of wrath poured vpon the <hi>Riuers and fountaines</hi> of that Earthly ſtate, that is, both vpon the heretical, and traiterous <hi>doctrines</hi> of that Sea of Rome, full of poyſon, and plots of villanies; and alſo vpon the <hi>Teachers</hi> thereof, which come like riuers and fountains from thence, and returne backe to the ſame againe: all tending, to ſeduce people from the truth, to withdraw ſubiects from their allegiance, that the Romiſh ſtate, whoriſh religion, and Sea of Rome might ſtill be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. In this the Lord our God ſet on worke, that moſt high and mightie Princeſſe <hi>ELISABETH, Semper eandem,</hi> a Queene of euerlasting memory, (their name rot, that doe her not honour) a zealous profeſſor, a true defender of the faith, a ſuccour to all her friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of religion, a hater of Poperie and Romiſh pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, enemies of the truth, a myrrour to the world, and a terror to all that bare ill will to Sion, and againſt whom ſhe had to doe; bleſſed be her name for euer. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties royall authoritie made theſe <hi>Riuers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, bloud;</hi> by cauſing it (and that moſt iustly) to be death for any Ieſuits or Prieſts, to come with their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,

And this is the <hi>Popes ſupremacie,</hi> vpon which wrath is come, and the viall of contempt is begun to be poured vpon the ſame. And in this hath our gracious God ſet on worke, the moſt high and mightie Monarch of great Brittaine, our now dread Soueraigne, our wiſe <hi>Salomon;</hi> whoſe moſt learned penne, in his Maieſties owne <hi>Preamble to his reprinted Apologie,</hi> hath made knowne to the Christian world (for which I ſay, and all Gods people; <hi>O King, liue for euer),</hi> that the ſupremacie of the Pope, is a proud vſurpation; that hee hath been (and of due, ſtill ought to be) ſubiect to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings, who are to challenge their right of him, and to take it out of the hands of that Antichriſtian Tyrant, that blaſphemous vſurper of Gods place; who will be as God in the temple of God, yea <hi>the moſt great</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1694:21"/> Chriſtian Common-wealth, and the moſt valiant Protector of the Pontifical power.</hi> But oh! how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhould he periſh, and come to a fearefull end; if the Lord would make a combination of the hearts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings againſt him, and his inuincible Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power in his pontificality? He would then, like <hi>Zid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kijah,</hi> that falſe Prophet, runne from chamber to cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeeking where to hide himſelfe. But let him boast, and preſume of his preuailing, till the time come, that the Beaſt be pulled out of his throne, and his kingdome become full of darkneſſe; which indeede is now the next thing, after the viall poured vpon the Sunne, that muſt come to paſſe. For the fifth viall muſt be poured vpon the <hi>Seate</hi> of the Beaſt, which is Rome it ſelfe, for there<note place="margin">Chap. 16. 10.</note> the Beaſts ſeate is; as it was before, the ſeate of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,<note place="margin">Chap. 13. 2.</note> which he gaue vnto the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>They are vnder, we ſee, now, the fourth viall. The fift therefore is the next, euen Romes ruine. Looke for it, in the due time, (O you valiant hearts). And when the houre commeth, feare not: but, I ſay, as did <hi>Ioab</hi> to <hi>Dauids</hi> armie, going to battell againſt the enemies of God, and their King, <hi>Be of good courage, and play</hi>

            <p>But it may be, you will ſay to me, that you perhaps ſhall not be employed herein. Well, for this, know for your comfort (you that deſire this honor), that this most noble Iland ſhall not haue the leaſt hand in this glorious enterpriſe, when the time appointed ſhall come. For what kingdome in all Chriſtendome, hath God made ſo renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the cauſe of religion, as this? Was it not <hi>our Conſtantine,</hi> that made a world of Chriſtians? <hi>Our Lucius,</hi> that was the firſt Chriſtian Monarch? Who was ſo valiant and powerfull a Champion for Chriſt, in the time of darkneſſe, before him, as <hi>our Iohn Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe?</hi> You haue heard, how the Lord hath ſet on worke, <hi>our</hi> valiant <hi>Henry; our</hi> noble <hi>Edward; our</hi> famous <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and now, <hi>our</hi> moſt learned and renowned King. What Nation gaue euer the Pope, and Spaniſh power, ſuch an ouerthrow, as this did, in the yeere 88? Hath not the Lord hitherto, euer made vs one, for his name, Church, and people, againſt that Antichriſt? and can you thinke, he will paſſe vs ouer in the laſt act of the tragicall end of Rome? Are not we one of the ten hornes,<note place="margin">Chap. 17. 11. 12.</note> that gaue our kingdome once to the Beaſt? For who went at the Popes commaund, to the holy Land, ſooner then we? Who defended the Pope, more then we? What kingdome, according to the power thereof, enriched the
<pb facs="tcp:1694:22"/> Popes coffers, ſo much as we? What King yeelded vp his Crowne to the Popes Legate, but ours? Thus were wee for him, and ſo ſhall wee be againſt him. And, as the<note place="margin">Chap. 17. 2.</note> Where made our Kings to loue her, and to commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with her: ſo haue they begun to hate her, and<note place="margin">Chap. 17. 16.</note> ſtill ſhall, and be with thoſe, as chiefe, that ſhall make her deſolate, and naked, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.

Why the Popes Bulls ſo terribly rore againſt <hi>vs.</hi> Why thoſe ſpirits of Diuels buſie themſelues ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>vs.</hi> Can any other reaſon be giuen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that the <hi>Diuell their Lord,</hi> and <hi>our deadly foe,</hi> ſuggeſteth into them, that wee are, and ſhall be, one of the greateſt meanes, vnder God Almightie, to bring an vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and deſolation to that Antichriſtian ſtate? And doe wee not all know, that there is a miraculous prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the higheſt, in ſoueraigne authoritie?

               <hi>ſlat</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>of the whole Church of Chriſt militant here vpon earth, is repreſented.</hi> And <hi>Graſſer</hi> ſaith, that the<note place="margin">In his <hi>Plagae Regiae by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</hi>
               </note> Apoſtle in the Epiſtles ſhadoweth out a moſt generall tincture of the Antichriſtian infection. And to me the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſeemeth probable (for otherwiſe will I not ſay of it) and my reaſons be theſe: I. Becauſe the number of ſeuen is kept here, as elſewhere in this prophecie repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 37 times; and is a number of perfection, ſeuen put for all of that, whereof the number is giuen: as here ſeuen Churches, for all the Chriſtian Churches; ſo ſeuen ſtars, all the Angels of the Churches; ſeuen ſpirits, all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold graces of the ſpirit. And from this number, <hi>Iunius</hi> in his Comment. ſaith, that it <hi>ſignifieth to vs perfectly and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iun. on cap. 1. verſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>generally the Church of Chriſt that is conuerſant here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi> And it may ſeeme likely that the number of ſeuen Churches (ſeeing there were moe beſides) was obſerued of the Lord for further purpoſe, then to note out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate onely and no more. II. Becauſe at the end of euery Epiſtle, though <hi>Iohn</hi> bee commanded to write to the Angell of that Church, and in him to that flocke; yet the exhortation is, to heare what the ſpirit ſaith to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and ſo by one, teaching all thoſe whereof that is a type: or if you will, ſo by one, all the ſeuen, and by them the whole vniuerſall Church. III. The things mentioned in the Epiſtles, (to wit, the alluſions to the old time, in theſe words, <hi>Iewes, Synagogue, doctrine of Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> not mentioned ſo in other Epiſtles, nor ſound to be in any other Churches, to whom any other of the Apoſtles did write) may ſeeme to intimate hereby, that
<pb facs="tcp:1694:24"/> ſome other thing is intended, then the diſcouerie only of theſe Churches preſent ſtate. So in like manner, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of ten daies perſecution to Smyrna (which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors are forced to ſtretch further then Smyrna, when they apply the hiſtorie to the text), biddeth vs in this Church ſo to conſider it in affliction, as it alſo may type out a more generall ſtate of Gods Church. Likewiſe the prediction of the houre of tentation to come vpon all the world, mentioned to Philadelphia, cannot concerne that Church in particular to haue that exemption from the ſame, more then the reſt of Chriſts Church then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that houre of tentation, but as it is here a type thereof. Furthermore, why ſhould thoſe Iewes in Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na be ſuffered to grow to ſuch a height of wickedneſſe, and muſt be made to ſtoupe to no Church, but to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and Church of Philadelphia? and why (I ſay) to this, and not to the other, or any of the reſt, but that they bee types of the ſeuerall times of the ſtate of Chriſts Church, as ſhall be ſhewed afterwards? IV. It is ſaid in the end of the Reuelation, after that all future things before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, touching the whole Church of Chriſt, and of the kingdome of Antichriſt, to the full, that Ieſus Chriſt ſent his Angell to teſtifie <hi>theſe things to vs in the Churches:</hi> which (as may ſeeme) can no otherwiſe be interpreted, but that theſe ſeuen Churches (for no other is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the whole prophecie) doe type out to vs, what in the reſt of the Reuelation is foretold, touching the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches future eſtate: which words, admitting this ſenſe, make the opinion cleere, that they ſet out the whole Church of Chriſt. V. Becauſe there is ſuch an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablenes of the Antitype to the type in the ſeuen-fold ſtate of the Church, following ſo cleerely one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the beholding thereof may induce a man very much to entertaine this opinion. Which to ſee more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, we muſt firſt make a ſeuen-fold ſtate of Chriſts Church, as there be ſeuen Churches. Secondly, as theſe Churches are ordered and ſet one after another, as firſt
<pb facs="tcp:1694:25"/> Epheſus, next Smyrna, and ſo foorth of the reſt: ſo one ſtate of the Church followeth another, the firſt may bee called the Epheſine ſtate; the ſecond, Smyrnean; the third, Pergamine; the fourth, Thyatiran, and ſo foorth to the ſeuenth and laſt. Thirdly, that euery Church is a type of that whole ſtate of the Church, whereof it is a type, and doth not type out any one particular Church, as Maſter <hi>Brigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>man</hi> would haue it in ſome, which I take to be herein his miſtake, as after I ſhall ſhew. Fourthly, Theſe Churches are types of the Chriſtian Church, as the ſame is troubled with Antichriſt in his breeding, riſing vp, height, the Churches knowledge of him, departing from him, and preuailing againſt him, as it is foretold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the reſt of this prophecie. Fifthly, that in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches therefore, wee muſt take notice of two things: firſt of the ſame as it is the Church of God, with her graces and defects; and then next, of Satan his inſtruments in euery of them: that ſo by the one, Chriſt and his Church may be typed out, and Antichriſt by the other; and the falſe Church may bee diſcerned in euery ſtate, as farre foorth as they be mentioned together, which is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the foure firſt Churches, but not in the three laſt. The foure firſt ſet out the ſtate of Chriſts Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and among whom Satan bred vp his eldeſt ſonne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, till that falſe Church came to bee Ieſabel, that whore of Babylon; the three laſt ſet out the three-fold ſtate of the Church, come out of Babylon. For let it bee marked, and the Reader ſhall ſee, that in the foure firſt there is mention made of the inſtruments of Satan, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing euill, getting ſtrength ouer the godly; but not ſo in the three laſt, being not at all in them named, but only once for the ioy and comfort of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus being firſt conſidered of, I will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poore abilitie, ſhew how theſe ſeuen Churches type out the ſeuen-fold ſtate of the whole Church of Chriſt, the Antitype anſwering fitly to euery type. The <hi>firſt type</hi> is <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Angell of which
<pb facs="tcp:1694:25"/> Church is commended for labour, patience, zeale, the vſing of his authoritie with boldneſſe and wiſedome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, and hating the deedes of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and yet at the length did decay in loue. In this Church were ſuch as tooke vpon them the name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but were none. The <hi>Antitype</hi> to this is the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine ſtate,</hi> as I may call it, becauſe the one is like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is that which we call the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> or firſt Chriſtian Church, during the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Apoſtolicall men, their immediate ſucceſſors; or, as ſome thinke, to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: in which theſe vertues of this Church of Epheſus did ſhine, This firſt Chriſtian Church was full of good workes, Paſtors<note place="margin">Iuſt. Mar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. 2. Euſeb. lib. 3. cap. 33. Iuſt. Apol. 2. Cyprians Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> painfull in teaching, the wicked not tolerated among them, but the cenſure of the Church paſſed vpon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, <hi>Tertul. Apologet. cap. 39. Origen</hi> in his treatiſe on Matth. 35. Hom. 7. on <hi>Ioſua.</hi> Great was the patience of the Saints and Teachers in the Church, whom perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could not daunt. Stories are plentifull for this. In which time the deedes of the Nicolaitans were hated, the Church was a pure virgine, from fleſhly filthineſſe and ſpirituall fornication, it had not yet waxed wanton with fleſhly deuices of humane wiſedome. But as the Angell of Epheſus left off his loue at length, euen ſo this Epheſine ſtate decaied in the firſt loue, declining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to worſe and worſe; as may be gathered from <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. lib. 4. 4.</note> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaking of the Church a little before <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian.</hi> It ſeemeth to bee like the ſtate of the Iſraelites, who ſerued the Lord all the daies of <hi>Ieſua</hi> and Elders ouerliuing him, but after fell away.</p>
            <p>Now Satan, in this defection of the Churches loue, ſlept not; but when ſhe began to be drowſie, hee awoke and roſe vp to ſow tares. And as Epheſus had counterfeit Apoſtles, the picture of falſe Teachers; ſo had this Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine ſtate deteſtable Heretikes, <hi>Menander, Ebion, Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> and diuers others. And thus wee ſee Epheſus, the type; and the Primitiue Church, the Epheſine ſtate.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1694:26"/>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Smyrna,</hi> poore and in affliction, yea and the ſame foretold to bee greater afterwards, though the time ſhould not be long. This poore afflicted Church is approued of God, as rich.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Smyrnean ſtate,</hi> which followed vpon the Epheſine, and was from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, (if the former extended thither) vnto the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Gratian,</hi> for that ſo the type and this Antitype a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth. This Smyrnean ſtate was poore and afflicted, more towards the end, then at the firſt; yet were euen there found ſuch as were, as this Angell of Smyrna, rich in gifts and graces, earneſtly contending for the truth; ſuch a one was <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> a right Smyrnean Angell. But this ſtate is better ſeene by conſidering the falſe Church, of which much is ſpoken in the type.</p>
            <p>At this time Satans kingdome was greatly encreaſed. His falſe Apoſtles in the Epheſine ſtate, had ſo beſtirred themſelues, as now in this Smyrnean there was a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan; before, onely a ſending out of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to gather a falſe Church, and here in this ſtate it was effected. So as now the counterfeit Chriſtians, and falſe Iewes, blaſphemed the true ſeruants of Chriſt, the true Smyrnean Angels; and they onely would bee the true Church. So heere was now Chriſtians (in name) perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Socra. lib. 2. 4. Theod. lib. 2. &amp; 4. Sozom. lib. 3. 4. 6</note> Chriſtians in deed. Theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> in type were <hi>Arian Biſhops</hi> and their fauourites in this Antitype, who would be the true Church, but were indeede the Synagogue of Satan, and fore-runners of Antichriſt. For from almoſt the beginning of the Epheſine ſtate in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, were many Antichriſts, and the myſterie of iniquitie was in working; and the now Antichriſt of Rome his ſeate was by Satan in theſe great broyles (yea and bloudy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) in preparing: when at this time a golden ſcepter was offered to <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> then Biſhop of Rome, by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 314. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</note> which howſoeuer it was refuſed, yet we may ſee Satans working, and abuſing the Emperors good mind, to get vp, in this Smyrnean ſtate, his ſonne of perdition
<pb facs="tcp:1694:26"/> into the chaire of peſtilence, and high throne, of which in the next Pergamine ſtate.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in a miſerable condition, dwelling where Satans throne was, yet holding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the truth, euen when ſome did ſuffer martyrdome for it, and when Balaamites and Nicolaitans were among them, which they too much bare with; ſo as the throne of Satan was erected, and falſe waies taught.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Pergamine</hi> ſtate following vpon the Smyrnean, which taking beginning from the time of <hi>Gratian,</hi> vnto the Popes, ſeated in their ſupremacie at Rome, the Diuels thrones, called the ſeate of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Reuel. 13. 2. continued a long time after, till neere the time of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe.</hi> In which time there yet were Pergamine Angels, ſuch as held faſt the truth of God. And of that Church were holy Martyrs ſuffering death. Such were Antipaſes, a ſit name to the Martyr in the type to be called <hi>Antipas,</hi> to ſet out the Martyrs now in this ſtate; who might haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name, either becauſe the whole world went after the Beaſt, and ſo they <hi>againſt all;</hi> or elſe for that they were againſt the Biſhop of Rome, called <hi>Papa,</hi> and ſo they <hi>Antipapa,</hi> for contending againſt the Pope and his pride. Among ſuch Martyrs were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Florentine, one <hi>Arnulphus, Gerardus,</hi> and <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus Nauarenſis,</hi> with others. Yet this was a fault in this Pergamine ſtate of the true Church, that though ſome ſuffered, yet the Church is blamed for too much forbearing; this was her weakneſſe.</p>
            <p>But now, touching the falſe Church. In the type at Pergamus, there was Satans throne, the murthering of <hi>Antipas,</hi> Teachers of the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans: ſo now, in the <hi>Antitype</hi> at Rome, the Pope inthronized in his ſupremacie by Satan, who, as it was ſaid, in the Epheſine ſtate, ſent out his falſe Apoſtles; in the Smyrnean, got a Synagogue and falſe Church; and here in the Pergamine, a throne: in which the ſonne of perdition being ſetled, murthered many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaſes,
<pb facs="tcp:1694:27"/> and like a falſe Prophet (as he is called, Reuel. 20. 19, euen another <hi>Balaam</hi>) taught <hi>Balacs,</hi> that is, the kings of the earth, to caſt a ſtumbling blocke before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael. That is, hee made them to take his part, to vphold his wicked Decrees, Canons, Conſtitutions, and Popiſh doctrines, and to force Chriſtians to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame; to eate things ſacrificed to Idols, that is, to allow of his Antichriſtian Idolatrie, worſhipping of Images, and praying to Saints, and ſo to commit whoredome againſt the Lord. Yea, ſuch was his filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the Nicolaitans doctrine muſt be held, that is, ſtewes muſt bee allowed; and rather then ſome ſort of perſons ſhould marry, fornication muſt bee committed, yea and mens wiues abuſed, being done <hi>cautè,</hi> though not <hi>castè,</hi> as the old ſaying hath been among them. Theſe things are ſo knowne, as the very relation, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtorie, is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth type</hi> is <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which is commended for loue, ſeruice, faith, patience, workes, and that the laſt workes were more then the firſt: yet herein faultie, in tolerating <hi>Ieſabel</hi> the falſe Propheteſſe among them, which Satan had raiſed to deceiue the people.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Thyatirane</hi> ſtate, following vpon the Pergamine, beginning ſomewhat before the twelfth hundreth yeere of Chriſt, when certain godly men prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched openly againſt Antichriſt, and many other things in Poperie. In this time were the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and other moe,<note place="margin">Tripart. hiſt. &amp; Henr. Monachus Toloſanus.</note> who ſhewed the commendable vertues of Thyatira; much charitie, ſeruice, faith, patience, and good workes. Which ſtate increaſed more and more in weldoing. For God raiſed vp <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and after him <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome of Prage,</hi> which greatly diſcouered the tyrannie, idolatrie, and filthineſſe of Rome, ſo as the Bohemians would no more be vnder the Diuels throne, as they had been. But towards the end this Thyatirane ſtate paſſed her beginning and middle ſtate, (in which, <hi>Ioſabel</hi> was too much ſuffered of many) when <hi>Luther</hi> with others
<pb facs="tcp:1694:27"/> ſhaked the Popes throne ſo, as they made him to quake, and his throne to continue tottering vnto this day. Thus much touching the true Church in this Thyatirane ſtate.</p>
            <p>Now for the falſe Church in the time of this ſtate, when Satan perceiued how now the game went; that the authoritie of his helliſh ſonne vpon his infernall throne, could not preuaile any further, but that the Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atirane Angels would breake out from vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: to keepe the Kings and inhabitants of the earth ſtill vnto the ſea of Rome, hee taught the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue to act <hi>Ieſabels</hi> part, euen to play the whore, the deceitfull Sorcereſſe, to paint now out her ſelfe with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious titles of antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, conſent, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, the Catholike Church, the ſeate of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and many other ſuch paintings: hauing alſo her falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to ſooth her vp, as the onely Propheteſſe and true Church that cannot erre; yea to worke miracles, thereby ſeducing the world, and enticing earthly mindes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whoredome with her, as is at large ſet out in Reuel. 13, and 17. Which great Whore there, is this <hi>Ieſabel</hi> here, whom (as in chapter 18) the Lord threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: ſo heere in this place, to kill her children with death.</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Sardis,</hi> which had workes, and gotten a name of life; but in the generall ſtate was dead, hauing onely a few names, which defiled not their garments. In this Church is no mention of falſe Apoſtles, Iewes, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, Balaam, Nicolaitans, Ieſabel, or any ſuch; becauſe this is a type of the Church, and the firſt of the three come out from Babylon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Sardine</hi> ſtate, the firſt ſtate of the reformed Church eſcaped from the Whore; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not here either <hi>Balaam,</hi> or <hi>Ieſabel</hi> mentioned, but the Church is conſidered as being come out of Babylon. This begun with <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and holdeth on to the time of the Harmony of Confeſſions publiſhed. In this
<pb facs="tcp:1694:28"/> ſtate the Lutheran Churches got a name, in which they ſeemed to reioyce more, as being come out from Rome; and were no Papiſts, then, indeed, ſound Proteſtants. For, as it was ſaid of the type, that her workes were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo may it bee ſaid of theſe in this Antitype, that their workes are imperfect, as appeareth by their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrines, and remainders of Popiſh deuices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Yet in this Sardine ſtate there was to bee found a few names, that is, ſome particular Churches, which cleerely quit themſelues of Popery, ſo as their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not defiled therewith, as is ſufficiently well knowne.</p>
            <p>The ſixth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which hath a doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before her, and none can ſhut it; and though her ſtrength be ſmall, yet ſhe holdeth the ſaith, and word of truth; and to her ſhall the falſe Iewes bee made ſubiect, and doe her all honour, as beloued of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> ſtate, and is now that wherein we doe liue, and ſhall continue to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Rome. In this ſtate, the paſſage of the Goſpell ſhall be no more letted; the doore is open by the power of Chriſt, and no man ſhall ſhut it: though our ſtrength (in the reaſon of man) be very little, the word ſhall be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, til the falſe Iewes (the Romiſh Catholikes) be made to ſtoope vnto vs, as wee haue afore time been ſubiect to Rome. And leſt this might ſeeme incredible, the Lord ſaith. I, (that is, he himſelfe,) will make them come and worſhip at our feete: it will be his worke, and not mans: neither ſhall this be done for our deſert, but his own loue to vs will bring it to paſſe; that they may know, that the Lord loueth vs. This is the <hi>beloued ſtate,</hi> this is the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian ſtate,</hi> beginning with the Harmonie and ſweete conſent of Confeſſions, wherein brotherly loue ſhould abound: which the Lord grant, euen for his Goſpels ſake, our peace, and the Enemies deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a luke-warme Church, neither hot nor cold, without all praiſes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1694:28"/>
            <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Laodician ſtate,</hi> which followeth next vpon this Philadelphian, after the Church of Chriſt hath gotten full victorie ouer the Enemies, and ſhall be inriched with abundance of all things, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which is that, which breedeth luke-warmneſſe. This ſtate then is not yet. For firſt, in the <hi>Philadelphian ſtate,</hi> the Enemies muſt be made to ſtoupe to vs, which is not yet come to paſſe: then a tentation muſt come ouer the world, from which mercifully the Philadelphian ſtate ſhall be preſerued; which I take to be the great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at Armageddon, Reu. 16. 16. vpon which ſhall come ſuch an Earthquake and alteration, as was neuer, ſince men dwelt vpon the earth: and laſtly, as is ſaid, in the Philadelphian ſtate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church muſt grow to ſuch wealth after theſe things, and enioy ſuch peace and liue ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, as ſhall breed that Laodician condition and ſtate, a time like the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> before the comming of the Sonne of man. But here wee muſt thinke, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtate ſhall not bee ſo of a ſudden; but onely by length of daies, after the Church hath floriſhed glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for a time in a moſt gracefull ſtate; as the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, in a very vnſpeakable manner.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, this ſheweth vs Maſter <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> errour, in making the Church of England to be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out by the Church of, Laodicea: when wee ſee, that theſe bee no types of any particular Church in any one Countrey or other; but are types generall, of a generall ſtate of Chriſt his Church. And hee himſelfe maketh no ſuch particular application in any of the firſt types; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, indeed, could hee, nor in this ought hee ſo to haue done. I cannot but bleſſe the Lord for very many things in his Commentary vpon the Reuelation; as (be it ſpoken without offence to any) being the beſt of moſt before him, that I haue read of, and a labour praiſe worthie; but for deſcending to ſuch particulars, as by the text and words of the prophecie cannot be made good. And yet haue I obſerued, that for theſe particular applications, his
<pb facs="tcp:1694:29"/> booke hath been more bought vp, then for the reſt of his moſt praiſe-worthie labour; and the ſame places ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, moſt ſtudied of all other: by ſome for the pleaſure they take in them, but without good ground from the text; and by otherſome, to carpe ſo at them, as thereby they may vilifie all the reſt of his paines; by which both the one ſort and the other might greatly profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, if they would lay aſide their by-reſpects in their readings, and giue themſelues to the beſt things, and make a right vſe thereof, in his and other mens labours. But as their ſiniſter readings on the one ſide, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cunning, perhaps, in their picked places; ſo it maketh them barten in the reſt of the prophecie, which I finde many very ignorant of, and yet can name very readily the fore-mentioned places. But I leaue them both, the one ſort to their ſelfe-pleaſing fancifulnes, and the other to their ill-bent carping peruerſnes, til the Lord teach them a better way to reade godly mens labours.</p>
            <p>Thus (Chriſtian Reader) haue I, as I promiſed, ſhewed briefly, what I thinke probably of this opinion touching theſe ſeuen Churches. In which (beſides what hath been ſpoken) may bee obſerued a gradation of corruption in euery ſtate, as if one came out of another. As, <hi>defeat of loue,</hi> or decay of zeale, in the Epheſine ſtate, brought <note n="*" place="margin">This is implied in the exhort. Reu. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>feare of man,</hi> in the Smyrnean. This feare brought forth <hi>a forbearing to deale with the wicked,</hi> in the Pergamine. This forbearing brought a <hi>plaine toleration,</hi> in the Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirane. This brought foorth a <hi>meere conformitie</hi> to a bare outward profeſſion, without the life of religion, in the Sardine.

But Satan not herewith contented, being full of miſchiefe and inueterate malice againſt the true Church, raiſed vp bloodie perſecutions againſt all Chriſtians by cruell heatheniſh Tyrants, who put to death infinite innocents: which wicked outrage and crueltie, Chriſt Ieſus auenged vpon the heads of theſe miſcreants to the full (of this we may reade chap. 12. and 6). And in time raiſed vp a Chriſtian Emperour, by whom was expelled the Dragons heathen power from ruling ouer the Church, and through whoſe embracing of Chriſtianitie, there became a world of Chriſtians; among whom the elect, faithfull, and true people of Chriſt were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily preſerued, albeit Satan aſſaied once more by a flood of nations, a barbarous people in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward furie and rage, to haue deſtroyed the remnant of the Church, chap. 12. But at the length finding his force to be of no force, he turned his courſe into ſubtill fraude, and ſo wrought, that hee bred his grand-child, that Antichriſt and Pope of Rome the Dragons ſubſtitute; who after deadly ſchiſmes, damnable hereſies, (he falling as a ſtarre from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1694:35"/> apoſtating from the truth through Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Satans power ſecretly working in and by him) led (through the thick ſmoake of darke ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) the Chriſtian world captiue againe into heatheniſh waies, into heretical doctrines and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous courſes; and became ſo great, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would not ſubmit themſelues to his yoke, were not ſuffered to liue; (of this we may reade, chap. 8. and 9. and 13.) and vnder this ſpirituall yoake of bondage liued the true Church troden vnder foote a long time, (cap. 11.) mercifully yet protected by the Lord Ieſus, (chap. 7. and 14.) vntill the time came that Antichriſt muſt be reuealed; then the Lord gaue his word vnto his ſeruants &amp; ſent them foorth to preach, (cap. 10.) who (though they indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great and bloodie perſecutions) yet preuailed againſt the beaſt, Chriſt plaguing his enemies, and making ſucceſſefully powerfull the labour of his ſeruants, by whom hitherto hee hath gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, and alſo now begun to poure foorth the vials of wrath againſt that Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtate, which is fallen into a deadly conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Thirdly, when it is called a myſterie, chap. 17. 5. which cannot be, as it was heathen, but Chriſten. Fourthly, when it is the beaſt with ſeuen heads and ten hornes, chap. 13. &amp; 17. 7. bearing vp the whore, and hauing Crownes vpon the hornes, chap. 13. for being Heatheniſh the Crownes were vpon the heads, and not on the hornes, chap. 12.

Seuenthly, when one of the heads is wounded and healed againe, then Rome is Babylon, chap. 13.

Therefore is it not Rome Heathen vnder the Emperous, which was neither then, nor before, the Church of Chriſt; but euer liued in Gentiliſme; wherefore Rome muſt be vnderſtood to be the whore, as it was Chriſten and an Apoſtaticall Church.

The text ſaith plainly, that the beaſt, deſcribed ſo as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw him bearing the whore, was not then, cap. 17. 10. 11. which may by reaſon be further proued; becauſe his originall is ſhewed vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> cap. 13. 1. which cannot be the originall of the Romane Empire; for that nothing prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied heere, muſt bee extended beyond the time of <hi>Iohns</hi> receiuing of this prophecie, cap. 4. 1. and 22. 6. Now the Romane Empire was, before <hi>Iohns</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, ſet out in the Dragon, whoſe originall therefore is not mentioned, chap. 12. 3. this one

Let my godlie and learned brethren (I humbly beſeech them) not reiect, as vaine, this aſſertion, though the moſt ſay, that this beaſt is the Romane Empire of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.

I. The Romane<note place="margin">The firſt beaſt in chap. 13. 1. is not the Heathen Empire, but the Popedome.</note> Heathen Monarchie was in <hi>Iohns</hi> daies typed out in the Dragon, as all the particulars ſhew, chap. 12.

This was not in <hi>Iohns</hi> daies, but to come, as before I haue ſhewed, and the reaſons alleaged. IV. The difference of this Monarchie is ſuch from that of the Heathen, as they can no waies agree. The Heathen Empire receiued her power, ſeate and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from no earthly power, but this wee ſee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1694:55"/> doth; whence that aroſe is not noted, but this is<note place="margin">Such difference betweene this beaſt and the heathen Empire of the Romanes, as they cannot poſſibly be one.</note> out of the Sea, chap. 13. 1; that had crownes vpon his head, this on his hornes: This followed of all the world with admiration and worſhipped, ſo was not the other; That was ſet out but by one forme of a Dragon, this by ſeueral beaſts in their parts; This muſt warre againſt the Saints, chap. 11. 7. and 13. 7. and theſe againſt him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and at length ouercome him, cap. 17. 14. 19. 20. ſo did not Chriſtians againſt the Heathen Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. The hornes of this, by which hee was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhall be his deſtruction, chap. 17. 16. ſo were not the hornes to the other. This hath his time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited 42 moneths, which the Papiſts acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that more truly then they wote of, to be the time of Anti-chriſt; and therefore cannot be the Heathen Empire, becauſe the beginning of this is after that, as is aforeſaid; this vnlike all that euer were before him, a beaſt of ſo variable beaſtly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as that, one beaſt is not enough to expreſſe his nature, and in chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 10. hee is not called the ſeuenth, but another, to note a variable difference from all the reſt before him: more ſuch differences might be noted. V. This beareth vp the Woman, which I haue prooued to bee Rome Chriſtian, which that neuer did. If we acknowledge the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Citie, this Babylon, and Babylon Rome, wee cannot hold this beaſt to be the Heathen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, for it continued not to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Whores ſitting vpon this beaſt. VI. This beaſt is in the daies of that beaſt, which the Papiſts acknowledge to bee Antichriſt, chap. 13. 12. 13. for there the text ſaith,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1694:56"/> he cauſed him to be worſhipped, exerciſing all his power before him, yea the beaſt, verſe 1, and this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt, which is the falſe Prophet, ſhall euer liue together as one, chap. 16, and periſh together, cap. 19. 20: therefore with the leaue of all the godlie learned, not offending them, I hope I may hence conclude that this beaſt is not the Romane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie Heathen, but indeede, and truth, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and againſt Chriſt in a Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Now how contrary to Chriſt this beaſt is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth<note place="margin">This beaſt is contrary to Chriſt.</note> fully from the text: I. Chriſt is againſt the Dragon, chap. 12. 7: but this and the Dragon be in amitie, chap. 13. 3. 4. II. Chriſt commeth from heauen, chap. 10. 1. this out of the bottomleſſe pit, chap. 11. 7. and 7. 8. III. Chriſt warreth on the Saints part, chap. 17. 14. this againſt them, chap. 11. 7. and 13. 7. and againſt Chriſt himſelfe with all his, chap. 19. 19. IV. Chriſt exalteth the true Church on high, chap. 14. 1. this with his Gentiles treadeth her vnder foote, cap. 11. 2. V. Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth his Miniſters, hauing them as ſtarres in his hand, chap. 1. and 2. 1. and praiſeth their well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chap. 2. and 3. This, for the diſcharging of their miniſterie and preaching, murthereth them, chap. 11. 7. VI. Chriſt honoureth his Father, but this like a very <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> blaſphemeth God, his name, his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heauen, cap. 13. 6. VII. Chriſt maintaineth his Spouſe, Bride and wife, araying her in fine linnen, cleane &amp; white, which is the righteouſnes of the Saints, cap. 19. 7. 8. This vpholdeth a damned and drunken common
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1694:56"/> whore, attyring her coſtly, to make others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit filthineſſe with her, cap. 17. 3. 4. 5. Therefore is this beaſt, that great and oppoſite enemy, euen that grand Antichriſt: So much for the propoſition, that <hi>This beaſt is Antichriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The minor propoſition is, <hi>The Pope is this beaſt,</hi> which, beſides the text, cap. 17. 11, I thus prooue: <hi>Whom this type onely ſetteth out and repreſenteth vnto vs, that is the Antitype and beaſt here meant.

For this Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, I. a Princedome or King-like, yea rather,<note place="margin">The agreement of the Popedome with this beaſt, chap. 13.</note> an Emperiall ſtate, as the word (beaſt) is taken in <hi>Daniel.</hi> II.

Such were the Kings of <hi>Spaine, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, France, Hungary, Bohemia, England, Scotland, Denmarke, Poland, Ruſsia</hi> with others. V. His heads, the high place of his Popedom hath aſcribed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is proper to God, to bee the foundation of Churches, the Vicar of Chriſts ſeate; yea vpon one of the gates of the Citie hath this blaſphemie been written to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, <hi>Meritò in terris crederis</hi>

This Popedom partakes of the Beares feete, it paſſed ſmoothly a long time, ſpreading farre and wide, and wherefoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſetled, there it left good teſtimonie of the piercing nailes, and ſtrength of the feeting behind continually. A Lions mouth it hath, terrible is it vpon the prey, and roaring out fearfull excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and curſings, making, as the Lion, the reſt of the beaſts of the forreſt to tremble with feare. VII. He hath (the Heathen Emperours taken out of the way) the Dragons power to enforce and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due perforce, as they did; his throne is Rome, for he hath reigned and obtained ſo great authoritie, as hee hath ſaid and done, euen what hee pleaſed, without controlement, as did the heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                     <p>VIII. It receiued a deadly wound by the Goths, Vandals, Hunnes, and other Northerne people comming as a flood, making as it were no being thereof for a ſpace, but the deadly wound was at length healed, and this Popedome, this Romane Eccleſiaſticall Monarchie and Papall dignitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued.</p>
                     <p>IX. With this pontificall ſtate fell the world in admiration, highly eſteeming the ſeate, for that it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1694:57"/> was the head of the Romane heathen Empire, and ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g was this beaſt (the Pope) in his Popedom, that none was able to make warre with him; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had the worſt, and their neckes haue been troden vpon, and glad they were to kiſſe his feete.</p>
                     <p>X. A mouth, that is, habilitie to declare his pleaſure, and power was giuen to the ſame by the flatterie of ſome learned men, by baſe feare of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, by the wicked decrees of Councels, and by Kings yeelding their power and kingdome to the beaſt: ſo as great things and very blaſphemies were commanded, taught and maintained by this Antichriſtian Hierarchie; for the particulars of theſe great things &amp; blaſphemies, reade D. <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> booke of Antichriſt, chap. 5.</p>
                     <p>XI. In this hautie ſtate and proud blaſphemous loftineſſe he hath had his 42 moneths to continue, or 1260 daies, to tread downe Gods true Church, which are prophetically put for yeeres, which is the full time of this popiſh rule and vſurped po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, now againe greatly decaied, bleſſed be God.</p>
                     <p>XII.

                     <p>XIII. This pontificall dignitie and power hath been ouer all kindreds, tongues and nations, this is the Vniuerſalitie which this beaſt hath, and we yeeld to the Popedome.</p>
                     <p>XIV. This Antichriſtian authoritie beareth vp
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1694:58"/> that whoriſh religion, for the woman Babylon ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thereon, as is noted chap. 17. 4.</p>
                     <p>XV. The Popes dominion was the next (to the heathen Emperours) that ſpred out it ſelfe from Rome, ſo conſidered is <hi>the beaſt</hi> that <hi>was,</hi> vz. in the beginning to riſe, but <hi>is not,</hi> vpon the comming-in of the Gothes &amp; Vandals was ouerthrowne for a time, and ſo in mens opinions ſeemed not to be, for that <hi>Genſericus</hi> bereaued Rome of euery dweller: <hi>Totilas</hi> made it a wilderneſſe, as <hi>Bloudus</hi> witneſſeth in his booke of Decad. And <hi>Adaulphus</hi> ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed Rome, as ſhe was minded to change her name to <hi>Gothia;</hi> ſo the reigne of theſe Gothes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the riſing of (this new dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the Popedom, which <hi>yet is</hi> had a being in the time of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian furie, and ſo was the ſeuenth head: but the Pope ariſing and recouering his begun dignitie, curing the wound giuen, and being eſtabliſhed in his Popedome, ruling ouer Kings and Emperors, was now as another gouernment, and ſtate from the former, and ſo in account <hi>the eighth,</hi> and yet of the ſeuen; to ſhew, that though hee be the eighth now, he is one of the ſeuen, as before he was, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the right in the Romane Kingdome, which one of the ſeuen heads, and not the eighth, muſt doe, for that the beaſt hath but ſeuen heads. And this is the reaſon, why he ſaith he is the eighth, and one of the ſeuen; to ſhew (I ſay) that being thus the eighth, yet he held the place among the ſeuen heads, and ſo his right to the beaſt, that is, to the Romane kingdome, and not to put vs into doubt, which of the ſeuen he ſhould be; when it is euident,

                     <p>Laſtly, this beaſt for al his great power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1694:59"/> goeth into perdition, in him this Romiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion muſt come to ruine. And doe not we ſee, bleſſed be God, doe all the Papiſts in the world what they can, that this Popedome decaieth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhall ſo doe, euen to vtter perdition?

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>If this beaſt be the Popedome, and not the Heathen Empire; why is it ſaid that he hath ſeuen heads and ten hornes, as that had?</hi>

For it is ſaid, chap. 13. 3.<note place="margin">Why the Dragon and Beaſt agree in ſeuen heads and ten hornes.</note> I. That the Dragon gaue him <hi>his power,</hi> that is, <hi>leaue, way,</hi> and withall, <hi>habilitie</hi> to ſucceed him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what hee had, he gaue to this beaſt, to make him great: thus is the word taken, chap. 17. 13. for when the Dragon (called the Diuell and Satan) chap. 12. 9. in the Heathen Emperours, was caſt

                     <p>II. Argument proouing the Pope (out of this<note place="margin">The ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Pope is that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note> booke) to be Antichriſt, is fetched from his ſeate at Rome thus: <hi>He that is the liuely head of that Church, which profeſsing Chriſt is againſt Chriſt &amp; his Church, is that Antichriſt.</hi> This is cleere from the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the true head and body together; for if the body bee againſt Chriſt, the head by which that body liueth and moueth, muſt needes bee againſt Chriſt. <hi>But the Pope is the head of that Church, which profeſsing Chriſt is againſt Chriſt and his Church.</hi> For hee is the head of the Romiſh Church, and that Citie, which firſt is myſticall Babylon, the whoriſh woman, chap. 17. 5. 18. as hath been proued, and the ſame alſo oppoſite to the true Church, as is alſo before fully ſhewed. <hi>Therefore is the Pope of Rome that Antichriſt.</hi> If any ſay, that they are not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians,

                     <p>III. Argument in this booke, is in chap. 13. 11,<note place="margin">The third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prouing the Pope that Antichriſt.</note> where mention is of another beaſt, from which I reaſon thus: <hi>This beaſt is that grand Antichriſt,</hi> ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith all men doe confeſſe, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 10. &amp; 15. de Pontif.

For he that exerciſeth all the power of the kingdome of Antichriſt, is Antichriſt: but this beaſt doth ſo, chap. 13. 11. for hee exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt, which I haue proued to be the kingdom of Antichriſt, or Romane Eccleſiaſticall ſtate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: therfore is this beaſt Antichriſt. Againe, this beaſt giueth life to that ſtate, chap. 13. 15. and with this beaſt that ſtate is ouerthrowne, chap. 19. 20: therefore is this the head thereof, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antichriſt. Many other arguments may be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the text, but theſe two ſhall ſuffice to confirme what is alreadie granted. <hi>But the Pope of Rome is this beaſt. Therefore that grand Antichriſt. He that is the eighth and one of the ſeuen, is this beaſt.</hi> This is alſo acknowledged by <hi>Bellarm. lib. de Pont.

Therefore the Church muſt firſt be attended vnto, and then the reaſon, the cauſes, and order of other things brought in, and foretold for the Churches ſake, will bee better vnderſtood, as will appeare by the order of the Chapters, and the orderly cauſe of things therein contained.</p>
                  <p>Now next and ſecondarily the greateſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt<note place="margin">A ſecond thing to be attended vnto, is the Churches grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemie.</note> enemie of Chriſt and his Church is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of; which is not here indeede the heathen Empire, and Tyrants then in <hi>Iohns</hi> time ruling the world, and bloudily perſecuting the Church, but the Popedome and Biſhop of Rome, that grand Antichriſt. For the Dragon and heathen Empire was well enough knowne to the Church then, ſo as there needed not a prophecie to ſpeake of that enemie or outward power and rage of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, further then to declare their end; and how Antichriſt came into the Dragons place, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his power, ſtate &amp; great authoritie: of which, in chap. 13. 3, this man of ſinne, this Antichriſtian ſtate, this myſterie of iniquitie is next the Church chiefly to bee conſidered of, as the enemie princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be diſcouered vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. For this Empire is the longeſt during, the heathen Tyrants from the time of <hi>Iohns</hi> receiuing this Reuelation (about <hi>anno</hi> 96, to <hi>anno</hi> 311, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> began his raigne) raigned but a ſmall ſpace about 215 yeeres; but this Antichriſt muſt haue his reigne 42 moneths of yeeres, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically ſpoken and expreſſed by daies, euery day being put for a yeere, is 1260 yeeres; and we ſee by lamentable experience, that he hath endured

                  <p>Againe, this enemie is the worſt that euer<note place="margin">The Pope the worſt enemie to the Church.</note> the Church had, for hee bloudily perſecuteth the godly, as did the heathen, chap. 11. 7: hee blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth God, his name, his tabernacle and Saints, chap. 13. 6, as they did; he hath done and yet doth trouble the world with bloudie warres (chap. 13. 7. and 17. 14.) as they did; hee hath gotten great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer kindreds, tongues and nations, chap. 13. 7, as they had; but he (which they could not doe, neither euer did) bewitcheth the world by ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, falſe miracles and wonders, chap. 13. 13. 14. and 19. 20. and will be worſhipped of all vpon perill of their ſtates and liues, chap. 13. 15. 16. 17. This ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth alſo ſoules, chap. 18. 13: ſo as he is ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Chriſtian world as neuer was: to which may bee added this to all the reſt, that his curſed apoſtacie brought vpon the Chriſtians, the helliſh furie and outrage of the Turkes power and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, chap. 9. 14. 15. 21. Laſtly, the greateſt part of this prophecie is ſpent about this wicked enemie, either in the preparation to his fall from the Church, chap. 8, or in the fall itſelfe, chap. 9, or in his riſing in worldly ſtate and power, chap. 13, or in his crueltie in perſecuting, chap. 11. and 13, or in his plagues begun vpon him, chap. 16, or in his womaniſh condition inticing to filthineſſe, chap. 17, or in the ouerthrow of his ſtate, chap. 18, or elſe laſtly in his owne finall deſtruction, chap. 19. This therefore is the grand Aduerſarie principally by this book to be found out, as the greateſt, the worſt and longeſt enemie in continuance againſt the

                  <p>The ſeuenth Chapter commeth in by the way<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> of a preuention. For in the time of the heathen tyrants, the Diuell had hatched and prepared great miſchiefes, that, againſt the time that the world ſhould become Chriſtian, (by meanes of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>) and the heathen Empire bee aboliſhed, hee might thereby ouerthrow the Church; which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes were prepared and aduanced vnder the ſixth ſeale, but the power thereof not ſeene, till the opening of the 7. ſeale. Now for that the plagues vnder the ſeuenth ſeale, in the blowing of the Trumpets, ſhould be ſo great a plague to the <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Chriſtian world by a fearfull apoſtacie, and that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1694:88"/> the Church might not doubt yet of her owne wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, here in this Chapter is giuen vs another ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral type of the Churches ſtate to the worlds end, ſhewing two things: I. That in the world of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians apoſtating with Antichriſt, there ſhould be a ſealed number, though but a very few in number, certainly preſerued from falling from Chriſt, and ſo eſcape this plague and the miſchiefs which God brought vpon the Chriſtian world for the earthlineſſe thereof, and for falling to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and that Romiſh Whore; for in this time are theſe ſealed Ones a hidden number with Chriſt Ieſus on the Mount, (chap. 14. 1.) and with the Prophets in the wildernes (chap. 11.) whitherto the Woman was fled, chap. 12. II. That the Lord in his time would bring theſe hidden Ones to light againe, and by the word win an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude vnto the Church of all nations, kindreds and people and tongues, to worſhip him, and to ſerue him ioyfully without interruption.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Chapter ſheweth vnder the ſeuenth<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> ſeale the breaking out of the miſchiefes reſtrained (in chap. 7. 1.) for a while; being from God ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plagues to the world, called Trumpets, and in themſelues the foure ſteps to the generall apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of that Romane Biſhop: for after the heathen perſecutors were taken away, the Diuell cauſed great contention among Chriſtians, ſet their mindes to ambition, and wrought effectually in many to make them damnable heretiques, and by part-takings was much bloudſhed. So that hereby found doctrine failed, ſincere worſhip decaied, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1694:89"/> faithfull teachers were hard to be found, but in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall a darke miſt of ignorance began to ſpread it ſelfe ouer the Chriſtian world, which was an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall meanes for Satan to worke thereby, for the aduancement of his grand-child the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that Antichriſt the Pope of Rome.</p>
                  <p>The ninth Chapter ſheweth that the apoſtaſie<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> was now come to a head; for here the fall is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit made a King, hauing his helliſh Locuſts to trouble and torment the earthly Chriſtians. Now was there a world of miſery vpon men &amp; manifold miſchiefes, the worſhipping of Diuels, and Idols the workes of mens hands, murthers, ſorceries, fornication, and thefts, for which God in his wrath ſent an horrible vengeance vpon them by the Turkiſh power, his hoſts and armies furiouſly raging: which yet brought not any amendment to the Antichriſtian ſtate and apoſtating Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>The 10. Chapter ſheweth how after long dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> and defection, the Lord (as he did to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites oppreſſed in Egypt) in mercie commeth downe to deliuer his people from this ſpirituall Egypt, (ſo called chap. 11. 8.) and doth furniſh with knowledge of Gods word ſuch as ſhould recouer by preaching of the truth from vnder the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian apoſtaſie, many again vnto the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, euen people &amp; nations, tongues &amp; kinreds.</p>
                  <p>The 11. Chapter is a ſtorie, as it were, of the<note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> great troubles which fell out vpon the Preachers executing faithfully their miniſtery, and in ſeeking to bring Chriſts people out of this Romiſh Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1694:89"/> as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did, in bringing the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from vnder the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Which Preachers, after great perſecutions and troubles, at the length preuailed; for which the people of God reioyced, as wee may doe at this day. And here is the end of the ſixth Trumpet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: the ſeuenth beginning to blow, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to raigne powerfully, and kingdomes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his from vnder Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>The 12. chapter beginneth the more large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation<note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> of ſuch things as were but obſcurely handled before, in chap. 6. touching the Romane Heathen Empire (vnder the type of the great red Dragon) and of the ouerthrow thereof, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might more cleerly ſee, when the out-Court (chap. 11. 2.) was giuen to the Gentile-like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the Romiſh Antichriſtians; and alſo when the true Church, the heauenly woman fled into the wilderneſſe, and when Antichriſt ſucceeded in the place of that Dragon.</p>
                  <p>The 13. chapter is a continuing-on of the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> amplifying that ſhort and briefe mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the beaſt, in chap. 11. 7. the very ſame that is heere now ſet out at large, ſubſtituted in the Dragons roome, ſo as now the old Pagan Empire, is turned into an Antichriſtian Popedome; the tyrannizing Emperours, into tyrannizing Popes; and the lawfull ciuill authority, into an vnlawfull <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and eccleſiaſticall Regencie: in which his originall, the meanes of his riſing vp, the power and properties of him, are fully laid open.</p>
                  <p>The 14. chapter goeth on to tell vs more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1694:90"/> what became of the ſealed number mentioned in cap. 7. where they were, and with whom, in that Antichriſtian Apoſtacie; then is ſhewed more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply alſo what was foreſhewed ſummarily concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the miniſtery of the word, (in cap. 10. 11. &amp;c. cap. 11. 3.) the Miniſters doctrine, the power and effect therof againſt Antichriſt, his <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> ſtate, and that whoriſh iuriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>The 15. chapter ſheweth, how the Church (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Chap. 15.</note> by the former miniſtery, and powerfull effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof, ſet free from the Romane beaſt, and his Antichriſtian power) now doth exceedintly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and is riſing vp into a preuailing eſtate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now receiued vials of wrath, and power from heauen to plague that ſtate, which ſo long time had wickedly ruled ouer the people of God.</p>
                  <p>The 16. chapter declareth in order, how from<note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> the Church, the inſtruments of Gods anger doe poure forth their vials of plagues, and doe execute vengeance according to the power and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God, with the effects and euents thereof.</p>
                  <p>The 17. chapter ſheweth the reaſon, why the<note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> Angels of theſe vials did ſo plague this Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate, therefore is it, that one of them infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Iohn</hi> of their doings, and expoundeth what is meant by the great City, and by Babylon, which the Preachers ſo preached againſt, in chap. 14. as alſo, what the beaſt is, which is mentioned in cap. 13. that we might know plainly <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Pope certainly to bee that Antichriſt, with the wicked conditions, pride, and cruelty of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1694:90"/> that whoriſh Church, for which ſhe, and all her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates receiued ſuch plagues, and deſerued ſo iuſtly to be puniſhed and hated of all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>The 18. chapter foretelleth, how vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als<note place="margin">Chap. 18.</note> poured out; alſo vpon the liuely diſcouery of her, not to bee the true Church, but that whore of Babylon; and withall, vpon their forſaking of her, who gaue their power and kingdome formerly vnto her, ſhe ſhould come to vtter ruine and her place and ſeat to be found no more.</p>
                  <p>The 19. chapter foretelleth, how great ioy the<note place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> Church of Chriſt ſhould conceiue at this deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſinging aloud praiſes vnto God for the ſame, being formerly exhorted thereunto, in cap 18. 20. and which here they performe, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another to praiſe the Lord, for this his righteous iudgement vpon this <hi>Babylon,</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſtate; after which, for further encreaſe of ioy, is foreſhewed the full victory ouer the beaſt and falſe prophet, with their finall damnation.</p>
                  <p>The 20. chapter falleth in, to ſpeake of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,<note place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> mentioned in chap. 12. and chap. 16. 13. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt what was become of him ſince his caſting out of heauen, and ſince the beginning of the raigne of his grand-child, the Antichriſt, ſet vp in the Dragons ſeat, cap. 13. 3. that hee was chained vp, and kept from his open rage a long time, but at length let looſe againe; and then ſecondly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that his looſing, and now alſo Antichriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, what his vtmoſt and laſt attempt ſhould be, to wit, open force, and what alſo ſhould be the

                  <p>The 21. and 22. chapters, after this deſtruction<note place="margin">Chap. 21. and 22</note> of theſe enemies; do ſet out the gracefull and moſt happie eſtate of Chriſts Church, in the gloriouſeſt manner that may bee, and ſo thereupon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this prophecie. And thus from chapter to chapter, wee ſee a moſt heauenly order obſerued, which being well marked and vnderſtood, will giue to the godly and ſtudious reader, a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the chiefe and principall things laid downe in this propheticall narration. If any doubt whether yet this be the order, courſe, and progreſſe hereof thus laid downe chapter by chapter: Let ſuch, (as I myſelfe haue done) painfully examine the truth by the matter in the chapters, and by the generall parts of the whole prophecie, and ſee whether this will ſtand, or another more agreeing to the text, and the truth of ſtory; if ſo, I imbrace the truth gladly, but if not, let this be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. He that would vnderſtand the order yet<note place="margin">The third thing to be obſerued, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the method.</note> more at large in particulars, he muſt make a <hi>literall analyſis</hi> of euery chapter, following the guiding of the ſpirit in his owne order, word for word. By which, this benefit ſhall hee reape, that the text ſhall become familiar vnto him, and the order of things more apparantly ſeene, and the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces better obſerued, and through Gods mercy, ſhall he ſee, (as I may ſay) round about him, that he miſtake not groſſely in giuing the ſenſe and meaning of a place (as ſome haue done) contrary
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1694:91"/> to the cleere light before them, in the very words of the text, which was for want of obſeruing this courſe, and withall, by an vnaduiſed ruſhing vpon the text, with a haſty interpretation, or with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued opinion, but vnexamined, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the truth. By this courſe ſhall he come to the firſt degree of the knowledge of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall narration exactly; for it is to be noted that there is a double knowledge, or rather a twofold<note place="margin">A twofold knowledge of a prophecie or rather two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof.</note> degree of vnderſtanding of the words of a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The <hi>firſt degree</hi> is this, to know what is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the very letter and words, without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application, further then in the text is laid open plainly, and alſo without the conſideration of the accompliſhment and fulfilling therof. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is to know the fulfilling, and to bee able rightly to accommodate to the text, the truth of ſtory, to declare the verity of it, according as in the words it is laid downe. The firſt is eaſie to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt euery one; as to tell for example, that the 12. chapters ſpeaketh of a woman thus and thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed; alſo how ſhe was with child and trauelled, and that there was a red Dragon watching, &amp;c. In like manner, chap. 17. there is mention made of a whore, and how ſhee is apparelled, and ſits on a beaſt in glorious rayment, with a cup in her hand, and ſo forward, as it is in the text. This may ſeeme an idle labour, which yet will not proue ſo to him that endeauours ſeriouſly to attaine to the ſecond degree, which indeed is wiſdome; but this other is in the firſt place to bee obſerued, that wee may know what to expect and looke for to be fulfilled.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1694:92"/> This firſt degree the holy and ancient people of God ſought after in the old Prophets, reading them diligently before they were fulfilled, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and waiting for the accompliſhment. The ſecond was the wiſedome in Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, applying fitly the Prophets ſayings, as they<note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> were fulfilled; the former vnderſtanding had the Scribes and Phariſies, who could readily tell by the words of the Prophet, where Chriſt ſhould be borne, and did expect his comming, but had not the knowledge to apply the ſame to the time, and to the perſon fulfilling the ſame, according to the prophecie of the place, where he was to be borne; and ſuch vnderſtanding may now alſo the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane high-prieſt, his Scribes and Phariſies haue, but the latter is the wiſedome of Gods ſeruants, to whom the Lord is pleaſed to make knowne his will. And thus much for the order, the ſecond thing to bee obſerued, to come to the knowledge of this diuine prophecie.</p>

The matter of this Prophecie, was things to come to

The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then of this prophecie is hiſtoricall, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be fulfilled. It is therefore not a ſpirituall or allegoricall, but an hiſtoricall ſenſe, which in this booke wee muſt attend vnto, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth chapter, to the end of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. For to <hi>Iohn</hi> was reuealed what things ſhould come to paſſe here vpon earth, before the worlds end, as far as concerned the Church; and the ſame he here ſetteth forth to vs, as to him it was reuealed. If we then doe looſe the hiſtoricall<note place="margin">The matter of this prophecie is hiſtoricall.</note> ſenſe, we looſe the proper ſenſe of this booke, what other ſpirituall vſe ſoeuer we make of it.</p>
                  <p>By this then we ſee what neceſſity there is to<note place="margin">It is neceſſary to be well read in hiſtories.</note> reade hiſtories, into which wee muſt looke and ſearch diligently, according to the times, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this prophetical narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in the reading of hiſtories we muſt be guided by the order kept here; and as the things are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the holy Ghoſt to come to paſſe: for as I haue afore noted, if Hiſtoriographers had kept the direct courſe of this prophecie in penning their ſtories, concerning all the troubles &amp; altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Church, they had cleerly commented vpon this prophecie, as far as it is fulfilled. And ſo ſhould theſe likewiſe that yet write an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſtorie of the things now in doing, or ſuch as liue to write what ſhall hereafter fall out. In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying<note place="margin">How to reade hiſtories with the order of this prophecie.</note> the hiſtories to the text, the way is to reade them in the order of the prophecie: and to doe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1694:93"/> this, we muſt conſider theſe things: I. That the narration of future things taketh date from the time that <hi>Iohn</hi> receiued this reuelation, as is to be learned from chap. 4. 1. and 22. 6. about <hi>Anno</hi> 96. in the raigne of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and therefore to begin from that time to reade, marking the order of the prophecie, and the fulfilling thereof.</p>
                  <p>II. That it beginneth with the Dragon, the Heathen perſecuting tyrants, in chap. 6. and 12. ſhewing how God would plague (with ſundry iudgements) the world then, chap. 6. and would ouerthrow that Empire, and caſt out thoſe Pagans for ruling and tyrannizing ouer the Church, as is noted in chap. 12. therefore the ſtories of thoſe times are to be ſtudiouſly read, attending vnto the text, as the ſpirit of God leadeth, to find the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and accompliſhment thereof accordingly.</p>
                  <p>III. That the prophecie carrieth vs from the Dragons rage, to the view of Antichriſt, but yet by degrees from the time of that godly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Emperour, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. And ſo we are to ſearch and apply the ſtories of thoſe times, but (I ſay) going on with the prophecie in the ſteps thereof concerning Antichriſt. As <hi>firſt</hi> to marke what went before the generall Apoſtacie of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or Romane Biſhop, ſet out in the blowing of the foure trumpets, in chap. 8. from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> daies, till about the yeere, as ſome thinke, of Chriſt, 530. or thereabout, ſome 230. yeeres ſpace; for expoſition whereof, the ſtories of thoſe times are to be ſearched into, the prophecie will be a guide into the ſtories, and theſe an expoſition to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1694:93"/> the prophecie. <hi>Then</hi> to conſider his getting into the Dragons ſeate, with power and great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cauſing a generall Apoſtaſie, (chap. 9. and 13.) regaining great glory to Rome, as before vnder the Heathen Emperours. To vnderſtand theſe things, and to haue an expoſition of the 9. 13. and 17. chapters, we muſt reade what Rome doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for the Romaniſts brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Constantines donation,</hi> giueth vs light to know how the Pope crept into the Emperiall ſeat; alſo we muſt reade the Popes <hi>liues,</hi> their <hi>decrees,</hi> their <hi>practiſes,</hi> in, and ouer Councels, the ariſing vp of their <hi>religious orders,</hi> the whole body of their <hi>Canon law</hi> their <hi>Legenda aurea,</hi> for lying miracles and words, their <hi>warres,</hi> with all other the deeds, power, ſeat, and great authority of that Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate, becauſe they giue cleere light vnto ſuch things, as be ſpoken of the beaſt in thoſe chapters, to the full. For how can the prophecie of the Pope and his popedome be otherwiſe cleered to vs, then by reading of thoſe things which are ſet forth of them by authenticke authors, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued authorities? So to come to vnderſtand ſuch things as be in the 10. 11. and 14. chapters, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ariſing of the Church from vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; as alſo the preaching of the Goſpell, to bring that hidden number vnto open light, the witneſſes of the truth and their doctrine; alſo Antichriſts oppoſition thereto, his tyrannie, and their conſtant ſuffering muſt be knowne by ſuch as haue faithfully made knowne theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Now for that Antichriſts power of generally
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1694:94"/> perſecuting is reſtrained, and that the true Church (bleſſed be God) now ſome late yeeres ſince, hath begun to get an vpper hand againſt him, as is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed in chap. 15, and 16, that they that killed muſt bee kild, and ſuch as murthered, muſt haue bloud to drinke, the vials of wrath being begun to be poured out vpon thoſe Antichriſtians from vs; as alſo for that this part of the prophecie is in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, and ſhall not now ceaſe till full wrath bee poured vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Romiſh ſtate, to the vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof. We may reade late writers, and, as<note place="margin">The ſtories of the preſent times co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning things done betweene Proteſtants and Papiſts, are to be read of vs.</note> I may ſay, yeſterday hiſtories, and make a daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of thoſe things which now doe fall out, or of late haue fallen out, betweene the Papiſts and the Proteſtants, eſpecially from the yeere 1558, or 60, about which time was the full period of the Popes generall preuailing; and ſince which time hee hath nothing increaſed vpon vs, but wee by Gods power haue preuailed againſt him, and ſo, maugre their malice, and in ſpite of their policie, trecheries and treaſons, we ſhall goe forward to a better eſtate againſt that Romiſh power for euer vnto the end.

Thirdly, in our

So as this nation may be the inſtance for al Chriſts people, to behold Gods mercie and fauour to his Church, to conclude the ouerthrow of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, according to this prophecie. And from which (if from ſuch ſtrange workes of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly any thing may bee concluded) it is moſt likely, that Rome it ſelfe ſhall chiefly receiue her vtter deſtruction, when God ſhall ſee his time, to aduance his glorie, by ſuch an heroicall ſpirit, and princely power, as he may, and can make fit to doe the deede, which verely is not long to, euen ſo, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be ſaid of this booke, as is ſaid by the Lord in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 12. 10. <hi>I haue multiplied viſions, and vſed ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:</hi> for here are manifold viſions and ſimilitudes; the Lord by certain formes, ſhapes, and figures, as it were Images and pictures, did liuely repreſent the whole Comicall tragedie, or tragicall Comedie, that was from the time of the reuealing of the Reuelation, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the ſtage of this world, by the Church militant, vnto his Apoſtle, and Prophet <hi>Iohn;</hi> who<note place="margin">This prophecie is deliuered, after the manner of prophecies of old, by viſions, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes and figuratiue ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> was an eare-witnes of all that was ſpoken, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of theſe ſhadowes and reſemblances of what was truly to be done vpon the earth, being played, as I may ſay, before him, euen as in the words it is written. So as we muſt learne by theſe viſions, things done, things in doing, or hereafter ſtill to bee done, till the world come to an end, as hath been alreadie ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as it is compoſed of ſuch ſimilitudes, ſo the words are figuratiue, the whole prophecie full of Metaphors, and almoſt altogether Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall; ſo as we muſt take heede, that we looke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then into the letter and naked relation of things, as they are ſet downe, otherwiſe the booke
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1694:96"/> ſhould be full of <hi>abſurdities, impoſsibilities, falſities, and flat contradictions</hi> vnto other truthes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: all which are farre from the words of Gods holy ſpirit, which are euer holy and true. For who can beleeue a Lambe to haue ſeuen eyes, a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine burning to be caſt into the ſea, and this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in a third part to become blood, a ſtarre to fall from heauen, Locuſts to bee of ſo monſtrous a ſhape, as is ſet downe in chap. 9. and horſes with Lions heads, fire, ſmoke, and brimſtone comming out of their mouthes, and a hundred ſuch things? Therefore wee muſt not ſticke in the letter, but ſearch out an hiſtoricall ſenſe, which is the truth intended, and ſo take the words typically, and not literally. For propheticall deſcriptions much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from common hiſtoricall narrations. A ſtorie ſets downe things indeed done: a prophecie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to the view, as preſent, by ſimilitudes, the things not come to paſſe, but afterwards to bee done.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we muſt note, and this very carefully, that<note place="margin">This prophecie is framed to the words of the Prophets, and cuſtome of the Jewes.</note> all this whole prophecie is framed after the ſtate and condition of the ancient people of God, the Iewes, and after the words and viſions of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prophets; as we may ſee by comparing the words and viſions of this booke, to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to which the Prophet <hi>Iohn</hi> alludeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere.<note place="margin">To what Iohn alludeth in this prophecie.</note> Firſt, to their ſufferings vnder their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, of which there were three: <hi>firſt, Pharaoh</hi> in Egypt, called by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> a Dragon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here mention of a Dragon, chap. 12.

The third and laſt enemy was <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> euen the Kings of Syria, and among them, chiefly <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> therefore the laſt enemies here are called <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> chap. 20.

Kings, chap. 1. Thrones, Crownes, and Elders, chap. 4. Thirdly, to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the old Prophets, as chap. 1. 7. to <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 8. and 21. 3. to <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 32. and 7. 17. and 21. 4. to <hi>Eſay</hi> 25. 8. and chap. 3. 12. to 1.

Yea the alluſions are euery where to the words of the old Teſtament, which were too long to ſet downe here, though moſt neceſſary to be quoted, of ſuch as would truly comment vpon this booke.</p>
                  <p>Now an alluſion is a reſpect had, and a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance<note place="margin">What an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is.</note> made vnto ſome other thing, agreeing in ſome ſort together; as in all the things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the Apoſtle, (or rather the holy Ghoſt) hath
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1694:97"/> reſpect vnto that which hath been formerly, and maketh ſome reſemblance in ſome ſort thereof in the things in hand, of which he (heere in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prophecie) doth ſpeake: which alluſions are made in this laſt booke of holy Scripture, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons: I. And that moſt vſually, rather for<note place="margin">Why Iohn is ſo full of alluſions.</note> amplification and illuſtration, then for proofe and confirmation: as for example, as Babylon held captiue Gods people a determined time, but at length they were deliuered, and Babylon at laſt, came to vtter deſtruction; ſo ſhall it be with Rome, ſpiritually captiuating Gods people, theſe being deliuered, and the heauenly Temple built, ſhe ſhall vtterly periſh, and ſo of euery other alluſion. II. For that the ancient people, their ſtate, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ceremonies, worſhips, Temple, City, Prieſts, and Kings, were liuely types of Chriſt and his kingdome of true Chriſtians; and therefore now doth our Prophet ſet out the truth by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and the ſubſtance by the very words of the ceremonies. III. To ſhew that the words and viſion of the holy Prophets, to which our Prophet alludeth, beſides the firſt and proper accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, had alſo typically in them a further ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and relation, as the frequent alluſions in this booke, from them doth ſhew, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the new Teſtament, Rom. 10. 18. Pſal. 19. 4. and Galath. 4. IV. To teach vs by theſe myſticall ſpeeches, (wrapping, as it were, the old couenant into the new, the Iewes into Chriſtianiſme, and we Chriſtians, by theſe typicall termes, made mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them) that the myſtery of God, declared to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1694:98"/> his ſeruants the Prophets, is not finiſhed, but ſhall be, when this prophecie is fulfilled, at the blowing of the ſeuenth trumpet, chap. 10. 7. Theſe I take to be the reaſons of theſe frequent alluſions, from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the Law, &amp; the Prophets: the knowledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the maner of the deliuering of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in ſimilitudes, types, tropes, figures, and alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will giue a great light to the vnderſtanding of this Reuelation, and preuent the foule miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of many things, by marking the alluſions, and the common vſe thereof. It would be a worke worthy praiſe, and requiring the diligence of a learned man, well acquainted with <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law and Prophets, to ſet downe throughout this prophecie, to what places of the old Teſtament, this our Prophet alludeth euery where; it would cleere many points, which for want of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are to many very obſcure; it would preuent an vſuall miſtaking, and an ignorantly-ſeeking of propriety of ſpeech, in a meere alluſion, as may be obſerued in the writings of men, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on ſome places of this prophecie. And thus much for the manner, the fourth thing to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to further our knowledge, in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this heauenly Reuelation.</p>

Elders is in chap. 4. we muſt conſider, firſt, that the chapter is a common type of Gods Church, and then theſe 24. the type of all the faithfull, both Kings and Prieſts, vnto God, which is cleere out of chapter 5. 9. for they bee redeemed by Chriſts blood, out of euery kindred, tongue, people, and nation; by which words it is euident, firſt, that they bee in type, men; ſecondly, Chriſtian men; thirdly, put for all, as beeing redeemed out of all places. Now this ſo vnderſtood, the alluſion muſt be to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 24. Elders, or chiefe Fathers, vnder a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, as theſe here, which is in the 1. Chron. 24.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1694:100"/> and 27. and therefore thereto the alluſion is, and not to any other place: for that the reſemblance cannot bee found elſewhere. So chapter 8. 3. 4. hath a type of one mediating betweene God and the people, to preſerue his from deſtruction; now to know whereto hee alludeth, wee muſt finde one hauing this office, to ſtand and offer at the Altar, which was the high Prieſts office, in the Leuiticall miniſterie; and therefore doth <hi>Iohn</hi> allude thereunto, Exodus, 30. 3. 7. 10. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus, 16. 17. Thus wee ſee how to know whereto our Prophet doth allude, in many of his alluſions; which one thing being well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, obſcurities will bee better cleered, the truth in differing opinions will bee more diſcerned, and the words of the prophecie become ſomewhat more eaſie to bee vnderſtood. For the alluſion will keepe vs to the reſemblance, it will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the place cleerely, it will affoord a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſpeech, and of the thing in hand, and preuent alſo moreouer groſſe miſtakings, and erronious expoſitions, as wee ſee in thoſe that make the 24. Elders, the 24. bookes of the old Teſtament; in others that make them the twelue Patriarkes, and twelue Apoſtles; all which looſe the alluſion, the ſcope of the chapter, alſo the hiſtoricall ſenſe, and are beſides moſt plainly conſuted, out of the 5. chapter, and the 9. verſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet for more full cleering of this point, about<note place="margin">Three things to be noted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an alluſion.</note> an alluſion, let theſe three things be diligently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Firſt, that all the alluſions from chap. 4. to the end of the prophecie, are taken out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1694:101"/> and therefore there let vs looke to finde them. Secondly, that in one and the ſame place of this prophecie there is varietie of alluſions, as chap. 4, and 5, ſo chap. 7: ſo in one chap. as in chap. 8. and 11, &amp;c. Thirdly, that albeit in an alluſion, there is a reſemblance and ſome proportion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one thing and another; yet may wee not thinke that in thoſe two places, one and the ſame thing is meant, as ſuch haue thought, who haue made the foure beaſts (chap. 4.) to be all one with thoſe in Ezech. chap. 1. 10. and 10. 14, becauſe there is ſome kinde of likenes betweene them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and faſhion. And thus much for the alluſion, which is to be obſerued in the expoſition.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Next after the alluſion, to interpret any<note place="margin">The third meanes. To marke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the place be expounded by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe.</note> place, let the Reader marke whether the holie Ghoſt doth expound the ſame or no: for as I haue ſhewed before, the Lord himſelfe doth interpret his owne meaning in very many places of this booke; whoſe interpretation is moſt faithfull and true. Now this his expoſition is two-fold, either<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſts expoſition is two-fold.</note> 
                     <hi>more cleere,</hi> and this is ſometime in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in chap. 1. 12, by verſe 20. and in chap. 17. 1, by verſe 15, and verſe 3, by verſe 9. 10. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in one and the ſame verſe of a chap. as chap. 4. 5. and 5. 6. and 19. 8. Or it is <hi>more obſcure and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> &amp; is to be found out thus, firſt by conſidering the words with all the circumſtances of the ſame place, alſo the argument of the chapt. and the ſcope thereof. Thus may wee ſee the foure beaſts in chap. 4, to be eccleſiaſticall perſons, the very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and circumſtances of the ſame chap. fully
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1694:101"/> ſheweth it: for it typeth out the whole militant Church in the head, and bodie, and principall members, and that vnto the end; their place, their properties, and their office conſidered, plainly tell vs what they be. So wee may ſee the great Citie mentioned chap. 17, to be Rome, the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſidered there, verſe 18, with the 9, and alſo the ſame to bee <hi>Babylon;</hi> for the great Citie is the Woman, verſ. 18, and the Woman hath a name written <hi>Babylon,</hi> in verſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the expoſition cannot be found in the ſame Chapter, then ſeeke the interpretation elſewhere; for ſurely the Scriptures are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scriptures, and the meaning of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to be found out by his owne words. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeke the like phraſe, words, or matter elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned, and there compare place with place, circumſtances with circumſtances, and one thing carefully with another, to finde out the true ſenſe of the place ſought for. But firſt ſeeke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thus in this booke, and if the book expound not euery thing in it ſelfe, then compare the place with other places of Scripture. As for example, I would know what is the <hi>beaſt</hi> in chap. 11. 7. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I looke into the very place it ſelfe, and do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue firſt, <hi>That he aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and then, that hee maketh <hi>warre againſt the Saints, and preuaileth.</hi> Now I ſeeke out firſt the word <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which I finde in chap. 13. 1: but there is not this originall nor practice here ſet downe, in chap. 11. 7 therefore I ſeek <hi>a beaſt—aſcending out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit,</hi> ſuch a one I finde in chap. 17. 8: next I ſeek
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1694:102"/> one making <hi>warre againſt the Saints, and preuailing,</hi> ſuch a one I finde in chap. 13. 7. Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the beaſt in chap. 13. 7. and 17. 8, is the ſame that is mentioned in chap. 11. 7, for the agreement is full without any difference. Now who, and what this beaſt is, I haue before fully ſhewed, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one place with another at large. Againe, I would know what is that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with the Lambe in chap. 14. 1. therefore I looke vpon the place, and finde a number 144000, and which haue the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name written in their forehead;</hi> I ſeeke therfore the number, and the marke in the forehead, and I finde it in chap. 7. 4, and thoſe there ſealed in the forehead; ſo as thoſe 144000, and the ſealed Ones in cap. 7, be one and the ſame number in the type, and therefore cannot be Iewes properly ſo called; but there is only an alluſion, the number are thoſe elect and faithfull number of Chriſtians protected by Chriſt, and hidden with him in the time of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts tyrannicall rule and dominion. Which expoſition the courſe of this prophecie and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the places will proue, if any doubt of it. If I would know what is the <hi>ſeale</hi> in chap. 7,<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 38. and 12. 13.</note> I ſeek in the Reuelation, but cannot find the word; therefore I conſider an alluſion in the ſpeech, and that I find in Ezech. 9. 4; by which in a reſemblance and conformitie of caſe, I ſee what kind of perſons theſe ſealed Ones in this Reuelation (chap. 7) be, ſuch as ſigh and crie for al the abominations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as they did, and therefore are protected as they were. Now for the expoſition of the ſeale, I finde by comparing of places, 2. Cor. 1. 22, with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1694:102"/> Epheſ. 4. 30, and 1. 13, that it is the earneſt of the holy ſpirit of promiſe giuen into their hearts, by which they are ſealed vnto the day of redemption. And thus doe wee ſee, that the holy ſpirit of God interpreteth himſelfe, either in this prophecie, or in ſome other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. With theſe helpes and meanes the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">The fourth meanes. Manifold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</note> interpreter muſt beſides haue with him theſe manifold conſiderations, as ſo many directions and guides in the way.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That from the beginning of the fourth chap.<note place="margin">The firſt is of the time of this prophecie.</note> are thoſe things handled, which concerne whollie and only the Chriſtian Church to the worlds end; and this prophecy taketh beginning from the time of the Reuelation made, and the things ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Ile <hi>Patmos;</hi> for ſo is it cleere by the words of him that ſpake vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> chap. 4. 1. and chap. 22. 6. which diuers learned men haue noted vpon the words of the chap. 4. 1, but haue not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in their expoſitions: and therefore haue greatly miſtaken things, and confounded the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and courſe of this prophecie. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giueth vs to know, that this prophecy of future things taketh beginning only in the raigne of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> the twelfth Romane Emperour after <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who exiled <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Patmos</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 96, or 97, or there about, as before is noted; aboue twentie yeeres after the deſtruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; ſo as hence may be noted, that it is an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſtaking to call backe the beginning of this prophecie, to the time and life of Chriſt, of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, of Ieruſalem, or any thing literally of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1694:103"/> Iewes. For although alluſions be frequent to the Iewes, yet this prophecie toucheth nothing thoſe times, much leſſe the times before from the worlds beginning; but it onely concerneth, as I ſay, the Chriſtian Church, as eaſily appeareth by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and whole courſe of all the parts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, from the beginning of the fourth Chapter vnto the end. Therefore to conclude this, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vpon this propheticall hiſtorie, taketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by and by after this was ſhewed vnto <hi>Iohn;</hi> which rule being kept, the whole order and courſe of the prophecie will be better ſeene, and the wide miſtakings of others better diſcerned, and their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror auoided.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That this part of this booke, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſeales, ſeuen trumpets, and ſeuen vials, and what they be.</note> of the ſixth Chapter to the end, (after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction in the fourth and fifth chapters) is ſet out in the opening of the ſeuen ſeales, blowing of ſeuen Trumpets, pouring out of ſeuen vials; of which for our better vnderſtanding we muſt know thus much: Firſt, that they be all plagues vpon the worldly ſort; the ſeales are plagues, the ſixth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth ſhew it, in the euents vpon the <hi>Heathen world;</hi> the Trumpets are plagues, the euents at the<note place="margin">They be all plagues vpon three ſorts, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, earthly Chriſtians, and Antichriſtians.</note> ſounding thereof doe manifeſt, chap. 8, and 9; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the three laſt are called woes, in chap. 9. 12. which fell vpon the <hi>earthly Chriſtians.</hi> The vials are plagues, the euents ſhew in chap. 16, and they bee called the ſeuen laſt plagues, cap. 15. 1, which light vpon the <hi>Antichriſtians;</hi> and by terming them the ſeuen laſt plagues, it teacheth that the former are plagues alſo. So as they tell vs, how God in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1694:103"/> firſt place reuenged himſelfe vpon the Heathen for deſpiſing the Goſpell, and perſecuting of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: in the opening of the ſeales which are the firſt plagues; how next (in the ſecond place) he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſuch as profeſſed Chriſtianitie, and were but earthly, and carnally minded, in the ſounding out of the Trumpets, in chap. 8. and 9. verſ. 21. the ſecond kinde of plagues: laſtly, how at length hee would plague theſe Antichriſtians for vpholding a defection, and an apoſtaticall courſe in the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the vials, chap. 16. which are the laſt plagues, as they be called, chap. 15. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that theſe are in order and time one<note place="margin">They are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and time one before another.</note> before another, the Seales before the Trumpets, and the Trumpets before the Vials; ſo one Seale is opened before another, ſo one Trumpet blowne before another, and one Viall poured out before another, as the order of 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. and 7. obſerued conſtantly by the holy Ghoſt in all of them eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently doth declare, chap. 6. &amp; 8. and 9. and 16. The Seales are the firſt ſorrowes, the Trumpets the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the Vials the third and laſt plagues; and ſo conſidered, are one before another in order and time. For the effects of the ſixe Seales, are before the ſeuenth Seale, which bringeth forth the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, whereof ſix be the proper euents thereof, then the ſeuenth Trumpet bringeth foorth as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects thereof the ſeuen Vials. Therefore the firſt Seale, Trumpet, and Viall, are not of one time, nor the ſecond Seale, Trumpet and Viall, nor ſo the 3. 4. 5. 6. 7, as ſome would haue them; for they are brought foorth one of another, as wee plainly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1694:104"/> ſee. Secondly, they are plagues vpon different ſorts of perſons, in differing times, as is aforeſaid, and as ſtorie wil witneſſe. Thirdly, this iumbling of them together, confoundeth the cleere order of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall narration, as the wiſe and iudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der acquainted with the order, will eaſily perceiue in the reading thereof. Such as hold this tenent, do make balkes of whole Chapters, either cutting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off, as idle; or elſe bringing them into ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiued order, as is without all order, either of the prophecie it ſelfe, or hiſtorie to explaine the ſame. Yea ſome would make the firſt of the ſeuen Churches, to agree with the firſt Seale, Trumpet and Viall; and the ſecond, with the ſecond, and ſo in order alſo throughout all the ſeuen: when the text ſheweth, that the ſeuen Churches are of the times then preſent, and the other three ſeuens, of the time to come, chap. 1. 19. and 4. 1. Yea euerie one may ſee, that will, how the ſeuen Seales, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Vials, differ both in varying types, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the degrees of euill:</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that one Seale from another Seale, one<note place="margin">They are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed within themſelues one from another, and how.</note> Trumpet from another Trumpet, one Viall from another Viall, is not diſtinguiſhed cleerely by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, but by diuerſity of matter, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euents. Therefore to find out the time of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Seale, ſounding of a Trumpet, and pouring out of a Viall, and ſo Seale from Seale, Trumpet from Trumpet, and Viall from Viall, wee are to marke carefully the diuers and ſundrie euents, of all, and euery one from another, and to ſearch in ſtorie, when ſuch things fell out, and ſo come both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1694:104"/> to a true and full diſtinction of them one from an other; and alſo to know whether they be as yet come to paſſe, or no. Neuertheleſſe note, that their<note place="margin">Note this.</note> perfect difference and a true diſcerning of them is not, nor cannot be taken from the firſt moment of the time of their beginning, but by the height of one from the height of another: for as the former or precedent plague, of Seale, Trumpet, or Viall, may hold on in the next ſucceeding, ſome ſpace of time; ſo may the latter take beginning before the former be come vnto the very height. For as God hath ordained iudgements, ſo haue they their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and their periods; which beginnings and endings in the continuation of linked plagues one continually ſucceeding another, haue their meaſures and termes betweene the height of the one, and the height of the other, from whence the ſeuerall plagues doe take their denomination, of 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. and 7. plague; or elſe at leaſt when the latter is come to ſuch a degree, as the former plague is not thought of, in compariſon of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in reſpect wherof the former euill is not much felt, albeit the euill effects thereof remaine ſtill; ſo in the height of the former, though the latter bee begun, and growing, yet is ſame much complained of, ſo long as the ſtrength of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer euill continueth. As for example, a man tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the gowte, in extremitie complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of that, as in a ſort his only diſeaſe, albeit the ſtone be breeding, which he but lightly feeleth, for the anguiſh of the gowte in extremitie or height; but when the ſtone is growne to the height of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1694:105"/> though the gowte be not gone, yet the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous torture of the ſtone, maketh the leſſe paine of the gowte, being ſomewhat alſo allaied, not to be remembred or ſpoken of, while the torment of the ſtone is in the height. So muſt wee conceiue of theſe plagues, in one Seale, Trumpet, and Viall, going before and following another, hereby right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſtinguiſh them, and to know one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where to begin the account, and to end the ſame: as alſo that we doe not miſtake them, when we ſee the effects of one with another, preceding and ſucceeding in a continuall linke one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely in Seale and Seale, Trumpet and Trumpet, Viall and Viall, but alſo in the Trumpets following vpon the Seales, &amp; the Vials the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in one continued courſe, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till all the wicked ſort be ouerthrowne. For this prophecie telleth vs, that there hath been from <hi>Iohns</hi> time til now, a continued vengeance of God vpon the wicked, firſt vpon thoſe that were not <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but Heathen, then on <hi>earthly and worldly Chriſtians,</hi> making a defection; and now is vpon the <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> and ſo ſhall continue till they be vtterly deſtroyed, as wee may ſee from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſixteenth Chapter, to the end of chap. 19: and by the parts of this prophecy, which are as it were drawne on and coupled one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Trumpets to the Seales, and Vials to the Trumpets, ſo as the ſame ſhew a continued courſe of Gods plagues vpon the wicked, till they bee deſtroyed, and the Church victoriouſlie exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1694:105"/>III. Wee are to conſider, that the beginning<note place="margin">The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Nothing paſt, or preſent, which hath the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in type vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to John.</note> and originall of any thing ſhewed in type vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not paſt, nor then preſent, when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation was ſhewed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> but to come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, according to that ſaying, <hi>I will ſhew thee the things that muſt be done hereafter,</hi> chap. 4. 1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſee that the originall of that great red Dragon, typing out the <hi>Heathen Empire,</hi> is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in chap. 12. becauſe it then was. But the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the beaſt, in chap. 13. is ſet downe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt that that beaſt was not in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, and ſo not a type of the <hi>Heathen Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The benefit of this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> This conſideration will diſtinguiſh betweene one thing and another, and by marking vnder what ſeale, trumpet, or viall, the originall is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, we may know the time. Which yet is not (as I take it) meant of the very beginning and firſt moment of time, but of the firſt powerfull effect of the thing typed, by which the ſame is notably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; as in chap. 9. 1. the fall of a ſtarre from heauen is ſet downe, which was yet in falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now was fallen vnder the fifth trumpet, to the place where it ſhould be. As appeareth by the power of the key, receiued forthwith vpon this fall mentioned. So chap. 13. 1. the riſing of the beaſt, muſt be vnderſtood of an eminent height, and not of a creeping, and ſecret riſing; for that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this riſing, his enthronizing, his great power and authority is mentioned withall; for the types here are remarkable things of that which is typed, at leaſt in the moſt principall matters, inſtruments, and agents, if not in all and euery particular.</p>

One in type, put for many, and all of that ſort, whereof the one is a type.</note> (except it bee of that whereof there is but one in nature) is to be taken for a generall type of all of that ſort, whereof that one is a type, paterning out the nature and acts of all: for in ſuch ſignes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, the agreement rather of the things themſelues, are to be marked, then the very vnities of perſons. In Exod. 4. 2 2. there is the ſingular number of perſon, put for all Gods people in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> It is not rare therefore to haue one put, to ſet out many, agreeing and alike in the ſame matter. Thus is Angell after Angell, chap. 14. 6. 8. 9. to bee taken for the ſeuerall ſorts of Euangelicall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, in the diuers ſingular types. So one or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a type, for one and the ſame thing in kind, condition, or office, is to bee ſo taken of ſome, at one time, as the ſucceeding poſterities alſo be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vnderſtood, and not a continuing of one and the ſelfe ſame to all ſucceeding ages. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the 24. Elders, chap. 4. are a type of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, euen then when this prophecie came to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as alſo of the poſteritie continuing in the faith, or ſuch as ſhall ſucceed in their place, they being dead. The foure beaſts are types of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall gouernours, not onely the firſt, but of the laſt that ſhall be, to the worlds ende.

So is the Church of Chriſt typed out diuerſly, in chap. 4. chap. 12. 7. chap. 14. 1. 5. chap. 15. 2. 3. chap. 19. 8. chap. 21. 1. 2. 10. 27. Likewiſe Antichriſt is diuerſly ſet out in ſundry types; chap. 9. 1. 11. chap. 13. 11. chap. 19. 20. as alſo the Miniſters of the Goſpell, by ſtarres, chap. 1. 20. by beaſts, chap. 4. 7. by Prophets, oliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, and candleſtickes, chap. 11. 3. 4. and by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, chap. 14. 6. 8. 9. This is neceſſary to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, leſt out of the variety of figures, termes and types, of one and the ſame perſon and thing, wee imagine differing things, and differing perſons.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That the holy deſcriptions here, and types<note place="margin">The ſixth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> of differing perſons and things, well weighed in all the circumſtances together, doe truly giue the<note place="margin">The deſcriptions of things, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, doe giue vs the true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them, one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note> difference of theſe differing things &amp; perſons, one from another; for the deſcriptions are not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and common, as that they may be applied, now to this, and then vnto that thing, which doth differ one from another: for that is contrary to the nature of a true deſcription of differing things, which ſhould, and here indeed doe, point out one thing from another, truly and faithfully, according to the meaning of the holy Ghoſt. Therefore as things the ſame, may not bee made differing; ſo things cleerly diſtinguiſhed, are not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1694:107"/> but yet to haue a right iudgement to know the ſame things to be the ſame, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh well, and to preuent this confounding of things, let vs conſider carefully in what they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in what they fully differ. For ſome things may in ſome light circumſtances varie a little, and yet be the ſame; ſo may there be ſome manner of agreement in ſome ſpeciall points, and yet againe withall, ſuch a cleere diſagreeing in ſome other maine matters and circumſtances of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as thereby they may bee fully knowne, not to be the ſame things. The Dragon and firſt beaſt, chap. 12. 3. and 13. 1. agree in ſome things plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in otherſome ſo diſagree, as they cannot be one and the ſame, as is before ſhewed at large. The ſtarre, chap. 9. 1. and the Angell, chap. 20. 1. agree in this, that both haue the key of the bottomleſſe pit, yet in other things, ſuch is the difference, as they cannot poſſibly be the ſame; the one falleth, (which is euer to bee heere in this booke taken in the euill part) but the other doth deſcend; the one openeth, the other ſhutteth the pit: the time alſo maketh a great difference, the one is vnder the ſixth ſeale, the other is vnder the fifth trumpet. The Angels, in chap. 7. 1. and chap. 9. 14. agree in number, 4. and 4. as alſo, that they all be angels of wrath; but yet ſuch is the difference, and ſo great, that by no meanes can they be one and the ſame: as by comparing them together, from their places and ſtanding, from their time before one another, and from their differing executions, may appeare. This conſideration is very behoofefull, to know
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1694:107"/> what things are one, and what doe differ, and are not the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. And laſtly, a ſpeciall conſideration is to<note place="margin">The ſeuenth conſideration.</note> be had of the times mentioned in this prophecie, which are put partly <hi>indefinitely,</hi> as in chap. 2. 10. Where ten a (certaine number) is put for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and is a common figuratiue number, thus put in many places: as in Gen. 31. 7. 41. and Num. 14. 22. Iob 19. 3. ſo halfe an houre, chap. 8. in all common ſpeech for a little ſpace; ſo is an hower, day, moneth, and yeere, in chap. 9. 15. put indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, which is a gradation of the time, the leſſer making the greater, as a day is of houres, a moneth of daies, and a yeere of monethes, to ſhew onely how from time to time, from the leaſt ſpace to the greateſt, God hath certainly ſet them their termes, which they ſhall not paſſe. Otherſome I take to be ſet downe <hi>definitiuely,</hi> yet ſo, as one number is ſet downe in proper termes, as is that of binding of the Dragon a thouſand yeeres; the reſt propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, daies put for yeeres, as in Dan. 9. 24. 25. 26. weekes of dayes for yeeres; ſuch are theſe numbers 5. moneths, chap. 9. 42. moneths, in chap. 11. 2. 1260. dayes, in chap. 11. 3. and 12. 6. And albeit they be alluſions, as ſome will haue the 5. moneths to allude to Gen. chap. 7. 24. as the time, two times and a halfe, to Dan. chap. 7. 25. which is all one with 42. moneths, and 1260. dayes, (counting 30. dayes to a moneth) that is three yeers and a halfe, alluding vnto 1. King. 17. 1. which time is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſo much, in Luk. 4. 25. Yet alluſions to the times in the old Teſtament, doe here no more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1694:108"/> take away the certainty and definiteneſſe of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; then the alluſion to the beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> taketh away the certainty of a ſtate in the beaſt, typed out vnto vs in chap. 13. 1. I confeſſe that alluſions in the numbers giuen vnto perſons; as the number of foure, to the foure beaſts; the number of 24. to the Elders; the number of 144000. in chap. 14. 1. and the number of twelue times twelue, to the Tribes, cannot be taken for ſo certaine a number, the abſurdities thereof is ſo apparent; but that theſe numbers of time before mentioned, are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and certaine limited ſpaces of time, wee may yeeld it; for that the ſpirit of God ſetteth downe<note place="margin">Why ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are heere to be taken definitely.</note> this number of fiue moneths, as it were; ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againe and againe; ſo the 42. and 1260. as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aduiſing vs to a carefull taking vp of the ſame; as alſo for that theſe numbers are tied to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumſtances of perſons and actions.

Laſtly, becauſe the holy Ghoſt taketh vp ſuch numbers of 5. 42. 1260. as are no where put inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely in Scripture, nor elſe in any common vſe of ſpeech, which the ſpirit doth not ſo much ſwerue from in ſuch things, but to make vs to vnderſtand more certainly times ſet downe.

The ſtorie of this time in the latter end of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and after him would (perhaps) cleer this more to vs. <hi>A bow:</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument vſed in warre, Pſal. 44. 6, it is put for ſome meanes, by which God vſeth to deſtroy the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Pſal. 7. 12.

A <hi>Crowne:</hi> noting victorie; the words conquering and to conquer giue the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and are added to this firſt plague, as the end why God doth puniſh, to bring men in ſubiection; which if it will not bee, then other and greater plagues ſhall follow, (ſo in Leuit. 26. 18. 24. 28.) as wee may note in euery one of theſe to bee greater degrees of plagues one after another. Whatſoeuer the plague here is, I cannot be induced to thinke it the power of the preaching of the Goſpell, firſt, becauſe the Goſpels power was knowne to all Gods Church, but this not knowne till the ſeale was opened. Secondly, this is one of the things to bee done after the reuealing of this prophecie,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1694:112"/> chap. 4. 1. Thirdly, the Goſpel cannot be counted, neither is noted any where, as a plague, in Gods word. Fourthly, becauſe the other types follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo the Trumpets and vials are plagues, therefore it ſeemeth to mee altogether an vtter miſtaking, to make this type to differ in nature from them all; and to make that a plague among the reſt, which is in deed and truth the firſt of all bleſſings, howſoeuer the wicked make it to them the ſauour of death. Fifthly and laſtly, this was ſuch a plague, as the faithfull beleeuers need rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp, by the firſt beaſts voyce as thunder, to take knowledge of the ſame. If I may giue my conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, I ſuppoſe it (with learned <hi>Iunius</hi>) to be the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence; firſt, becauſe the arrow and peſtilence are together in Pſal. 91. 5. 6. Secondly, it is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which God of all other moſt triumpheth, as being his immediate hand, and acted of him, as in triumph, when ſuch as bee ſo plagued doe lie dead before him, and hee riding ouer their heads. Thirdly, becauſe of the degrees of theſe euils, one greater then another; as firſt peſtilence here; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſword, in verſ. 4; the third, famine, in verſ. 5. 6; the fourth, all theſe foure great plagues together, verſ. 8.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>A type of famine:</hi> The horſes colour, the enſignes and the voyce giue the explication, and ſhew what is hereby meant. The voyce in the middeſt of the foure beaſts, is the voyce of Chriſt,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1694:113"/> for he is in the middeſt of them, chap. 5. 6.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>A type of deadly mortalitie.</hi> The colour of the horſe, the name of the Rider, his power to kill by the ſword, doe tell vs fully the meaning of this type; the alluſion is to the foure great plagues in Ezech. 14. 21.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. 10. 11. <hi>A type of the bloudy ſlaughter of Chriſtian Martyrs</hi> calling for vengeance againſt their cruell perſecutors, as <hi>Abels</hi> bloud did for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon <hi>Caine,</hi> Gen. 4. 10; as alſo ſhewing Gods iuſtice ready to auenge the bloud of his Saints vpon the murtherers, ſo as here alſo is giuen a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the equitie of the great plague in the ſixth ſeale. This is a great plague of God, to bee guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of innocent bloud, which ſo loudly crieth in Gods eares, as in iuſtice he cannot, but as a Lord holy and true, iudge and auenge the ſame, verſe 9. an alluſion to Exod. 29. 12, where the bloud of the ſacrifice was poured out, at the bottome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.

For their robes are only made white by Chriſts bloud, cap. 7. 13. The crying loud voyce, and anſwere thereto, muſt bee well noted, for they ſhew the ſcope and meaning of the type.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1694:114"/> ſpeaking, <hi>holding of the winds from blowing,</hi> is noted here a plague, which ſhould bee hurtfull to the earth, ſea, and trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wind:</hi> Foure winds are named, becauſe of the parts of the earth from whence they blow, yet in nature all but one, and therefore alſo hee heere ſpeaketh ſingularly, that the <hi>wind ſhould not blow. Wind</hi> is here taken figuratiuely, we cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it after the letter, for wee reade not of euer any ſuch plague, and if any ſuch had been, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones could not haue eſcaped it, being ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, and being ſo notable a plague, it could not but haue been obſerued of ſome in the world. Therefore by <hi>winds,</hi> we muſt conceiue ſome other thing then wind properly, euen an heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and ſpirituall breathing of truth; as it is taken in Cant. 4. 18. Ioh. 3. 8. Act. 2. 2. which theſe are ſaid to hold, by hindering the faithfull and ſincere preaching therof. A ſpirituall plague vpon the earthly Chriſtians, is here to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which now followeth after all the former corporall plagues vpon the Heathen. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation ſignified by the ſealing in the fore-head is ſpirituall, &amp; ſuch a preſeruation as keepeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſealed, ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hurt which the earth, ſea, and trees were ſubiect vnto, verſ. 3. And this calamity, though prepared vnder the 6. ſeale, yet hath his force and power felt vnder the ſeuenth ſeale; the euents whereof are ſpirituall plagues, contention, ambition, corruption of doctrine, fearfull Apoſtaſie, and Antichriſts getting into his throne, the falſe prophet deceiuing the world;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1694:115"/> all which follow vpon the blowing of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, the proper effects of the ſeuenth ſeale, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of theſe withholders of the wind, are a part, and from whence the other miſchiefes enſue, which yet ſo are ſpirituall, as there is alſo corporall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities often mixed therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Earth:</hi> Is the place of the viſible Church; and the earthly ones of it, among which the ſealed ones are, and therefore need ſpeciall protection. <hi>Sea:</hi> is the common worſhip, pure, or impure. <hi>Trees:</hi> are men, chap. 9. 4. to which vſually men are compared in the Scriptures, Pſalm. 1. 3. Eſa. 61. 3. Ezra. 47. 7. as the wind and withholding thereof, hath a ſpirituall interpretation, ſo muſt theſe alſo. For if they be taken literally, they are not capable of a ſpirituall plague. Of the <hi>Seale:</hi> ſee before in chap. 5. of this preparatiue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of all the tribes of the children of Iſrael:</hi> As the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were together the viſible Church of God, yet but a choſen number the true Iſraelites indeed, Rom. 9. 8. 27. for all were not Iſrael, which were of Iſraell, Rom. 9. 6. neither he a Iew which is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but one inward, Rom. 2. 28. ſo here by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to them, the Prophet ſheweth, that among Chriſtians, and in the viſible Church of Chriſt, and in the ouerſpreading of Antichriſt, there are only a ſpeciall choſen number, in compariſon of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, a few the true Iſraelites of God, as they be called, Galath. 6. 16. For an Iſraelite and Iew, are now common names to Iewes and Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites by nature, and to <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Iſraelites and Iewes by grace. For ſuch as be of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1694:115"/> are his children, Galath. 3. 7. and now the Iſraelites of God, are now Iewes inward, and circumciſed in heart, Rom. 2. 29. Theſe heere are not to bee taken for Iſraelites properly, and naturall Iewes, for the conſideration of the time here to bee noted, when this number was taken, will not permit that they ſhould be ſo vnderſtood. Againe, this is a part of the things to be done after <hi>Iohns</hi> time, chap. 4. 1. Moreouer this number of 12. times 12. is the ſame with chap. 14. 1. that number of an 144000. which was in Antichriſts time; theſe haue alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name of the ſeruants of God giuen them, in verſ. 3. of this chapter, and which ſung the new ſong, in chap. 14. 3. before the throne, and before the beaſt, and Elders, that is, in the true Chriſtian Church. And what ſhould perſwade any man to thinke, that God reſpected only the Iewes, to ſeale them, and to let paſſe all other true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, vnder this ſo great and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall a plague, here foreſhewed to be ouer all parts of the earth, from which theſe ſealed ones were to be exempted? Therefore the ſealed ones are all that choſen and ſecret number of true and faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt, following him, and redeemed from among men, being the firſt fruites vnto God, and to the Lambe, (chapt. 14. 4.) preſerued in the generall defection and Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, till the light ſhould breake forth againe, and a great multitude without number be added to them, and ſo make an open profeſſion of Chriſt, and ſincerely worſhipping of him, as is foreſhewed here in this chap. 7. 9. 15.</p>

Falling</hi> is to be taken in the worſt part in this booke, it may bee an alluſion to Eſai. 14. 12. This falling or great apoſtaſie, grew vp by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer euils mentioned in the other Chap. as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſteps to this, which is the firſt of the three woes ſpoken of before. <hi>From heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the earth:</hi> that is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heauenly ſtate of the true Church, to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate among earthly Chriſtians.

                        <hi>Key:</hi> This is a ſigne of gouernment, Eſai. 22. 22: ſo this Apoſtaticall Biſhop, obtained to haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie in the earthly Church: but this <hi>key</hi> is the <hi>key of the bottomleſſe pit;</hi> by this cannot be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1694:119"/> meant properly hell, for all the words are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: <hi>Starre, Heauen, Earth, Key,</hi> and ſo the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in verſ. 2. 3. &amp;c. Againe, this booke being a propheticall hiſtorie of things here to be done on earth, wee muſt needes here finde <hi>things done</hi> by men, and among men; it were very abſurd to take it then for hell it ſelfe, for it breeds no Locuſts, that can come out thence to hurt men heere in this world; neither hath any earthly man power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or ſhut that place. Therefore theſe words of the <hi>bottomleſſe pit</hi> are added to ſhew, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which this Apoſtaticall Churchman hath, is a helliſh and a deſtroying power and iuriſdiction, according to his name <hi>Apollyon,</hi> in the height of this his dominion and rule, verſ. 11, and is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the kingdome of the Diuell and darknes.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>The opening of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> is the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his key and authoritie to cauſe thoſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euils to bee, which are of the diuell, and as it were from hell, for the depth of the impious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes thereof, leading to vtter perdition.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Smoake:</hi> This is of a moiſt and earthie matter very hurtfull to the eyes, and cauſing obſcuritie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the light, that wee cannot ſee, which is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1694:119"/> the effect of the ſmoake here; ſo hereby is meant ſpiritually, whatſoeuer, as ſmoake, darkeneth the light of truth, as errors, hereſies, inuentions of men, humane traditions, will-worſhip, ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, Decrees and Canons, inhibiting the cleere ſhining foorth of the light, and ſuch like. The <hi>ſmoake</hi> cannot be the darknes it ſelfe, but is the cauſe of it, the words of the text diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Locuſts:</hi> Theſe are, after the ſtarre is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and after that his authoritie is obtained, and put in execution. The pit maketh the ſmoake, and the ſmoake breedeth theſe Locuſts, who with the ſtarre are vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, ſo as they haue their whole dependencie from the ſtarre; which being the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall Biſhop of Rome, theſe muſt needes be his Romane clergie. By Locuſts cannot be vnderſtood the Saracens; firſt, for that theſe Locuſts ariſe vpon the fal of a great Churchman, are vnder his power, and are let out to the earth by him. What Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man once in heauen, that is, in the true Church, were euer the Saracens vnder? Againe, theſe are bred of that ignorance and darknes, which came ouer the light of the Church, in which they were; but not ſo, the Saracens. Thirdly, theſe haue no power allowed to kill, but to torment people, and that only the caſt-awaies; when the Saracens made horrible ſlaughters of all ſorts. Laſtly, theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts liuely paint out vnto vs the popiſh Clergie, by which deſcription is foretold, what they ſhould be, and what now the world haue found them to be, as the particulars doe ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. Firſt theſe Locuſts <hi>are like horſes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1694:120"/> vnto battell,</hi> that is, they goe out with ſtrength, fierce courage, and ready bent to attempt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they ſhall bee put vnto; ſuch haue been the Romane Clergie, like luſtie, fed, ſtrong and fierce horſes, ready to ruſh vpon all, that did but mutter againſt them and their authoritie. Secondly, <hi>on their heads were as it were Crownes of gold:</hi> This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out both their immunities from Kings, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubiects to none, except to their owne king, the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit) as alſo their vſurped authoritie; for <hi>Crownes</hi> note authority, which they alſo got, commanding and ruling, euen as Kings<note place="margin">
                           <hi>By Crowne ſome hold the round ſhauing of the crowne of the head: the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the head is a crowne.</hi> Leuit. 21. 12.</note> for a time; yet their Crownes were but <hi>as it were of gold,</hi> they were not truly Crownes of gold, that is, their authoritie was but counterfeit, not true and lawfull indeed, onely like to gold, that is, which carried a ſhew of lawfull authoritie, but in very truth counterfeited and falſe. Such as was, in the ſhew therof, ſo like gold, as the blind world could not then, in the ſmoakie darkneſſe of thoſe times, ſee &amp; rightly iudge of, becauſe they wanted Gods word, the true touchſtone to trie gold by. It is here by the way worthie our noting, that the type of the true Church-men in the foure beaſts are not crowned (chap. 4.) but theſe Locuſts muſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere. Thirdly, <hi>Their faces were as the faces of men:</hi> Here is noted their hypocriticall ſhew of curteſie and humanitie; but they were nothing leſſe then they pretended to bee, that is, they made ſhew to be gentle, louing, full of curteſie by bowing and becking, that by theſe means and fawning inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they might allure the peoples harts vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:1694:120"/>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. Fourthly, <hi>They had haire as the haire of women:</hi> This noteth their effeminatenes, their luſt, and wantonnes in themſelues, and withall their carnall allurements to ſpirituall idolatrie, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe by their haire intice to corporall filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Fifthly, <hi>And their teeth were as the teeth of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> This ſheweth their ſtrong deuouring of their prey. Where they ſet their teeth, that could not be gotten from them. How they got lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, and preyed vpon the eſtates of men, the world can witneſſe, and the ſignes, where they ſet their teeth, yet remaine among vs? They are of a deuouring nature, Deut. 28. 38. 2. Chron. 7. 13. for Locuſts are moſt belly, and therefore inſatiable. Sixthly, <hi>They had breaſt-plates of iron:</hi> They were of<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> daring ſpirits, being hardned as iron in their harts, in their vnmercifull deuourings, and are armed ſtrongly with their kings power, as with a corſelet of iron, ſo as they were without feare of any; and what durſt they not doe? and who durſt reſiſt them, or offer violence to any of them? for they were all alike, and all armed alike, how differing ſo euer in themſelues. Seuenthly, <hi>They had wings,</hi> to paſſe with more ſpeed, and to get vp aloft, <hi>the ſound whereof was as the ſound of chariots of many horſes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to battell:</hi> This ſetteth out the great feare they wrought in al places where they came, for the noiſe of chariots and horſes is terrible, as appeareth 2. King. 7. 6. 7, which made the Syrians leaue al that they had, to the King of Iſrael and his people; and ſuch effect this their ſound wrought in mens harts, to make them to leaue all to them and their king,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1694:121"/> for ſafetie of their ſoules, as they fooliſhly and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imagined. Eightly, <hi>They had tailes like vnto</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Scorpions, and there were ſtings in their tailes: Tailes</hi> are aſcribed to all the Locuſts, without diſtinction, and alſo to haue ſtings all of them in their tailes; therefore by <hi>tailes</hi> cannot be meant any particular ſort of them. <hi>Tailes</hi> ſometime are put for the baſe and contemptible ſort, as in Deut. 28. 13. 44. Eſai. 9. 15, but then the <hi>Head</hi> is of one ſort, and the <hi>Taile</hi> vnderſtood of another, and not both attributed to the ſame things, as is here, and in verſ. 19. <hi>Tailes</hi> are the hindermoſt part and furtheſt from the ſight of thoſe, which behold and look vpon the fore-parts; and therfore as the fore-parts of theſe Locuſts haue been ſet out, and thereby their properties, ſo here is noted to vs by <hi>Tailes</hi> that, whereby they doe play the <hi>Scorpions,</hi> and ſting men vnwitting to them at the firſt. This is the power they haue, and this is the end of their comming foorth, euen to play the Scorpions with their tailes, (verſ. 3.) ſtinging men therewith, and ſo grieuouſly tormenting them, (verſ. 5.) as they ſhall bee thereby weary of their liues, verſ. 6. So the plague and miſchiefe, which theſe Locuſts bring, is chiefly by their tailes, that is, their laſt (but worſt) act, which is their popiſh &amp; <hi>Antichriſtian doctrine;</hi> for this is common to them all, and may bee called a <hi>taile,</hi> for the baſenes and filthineſſe therof. It hath alſo the nature of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, for as the Scorpion is firſt <hi>earthy,</hi> ſo is their doctrine, earthly mens inuentions: ſecondly, <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonfull,</hi> ſo is this doctrine, as poyſon infecting their ſoule, with ſuperſtition, will-worſhip, idolatrie, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1694:121"/> equiuocations, deceits and periuries, alſo with heatheniſh practiſes, yea helliſh attempts, treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, treaſons, and rebellions. Thirdly, as ſome doe write, the Scorpions poyſon is white; ſo this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian doctrine to the ignorant and beſotted people is white, that is, ſeemeth pure and good, though it bee poyſon indeede vnto the ſoule. Fourthly, the Scorpion when he would ſtrike, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe ſomewhat round before hee can doe it; ſo this doctrine of the beaſts, before it can bee made to bee receiued, muſt come circularly about, by pretended antiquitie, conceited vniuerſalitie, and fained conſent, that it might enter more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into weake hearts. Laſtly, a Scorpion hath a ſting which woundeth deadly; but women (as one writeth) ſooner then men, whom yet alſo they<note place="margin">Bartho. Angl. lib. 18. cap. 96.</note> greatly hurt, but eſpecially when in the morning the Scorpions come out of their holes: ſo this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian doctrine, deadly woundeth weake wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſooner, as <hi>Eue,</hi> receiue the Serpents falſe perſwaſion, then <hi>Adam.</hi> As now our preſent daies ſhew vs by experience, ſo doth it ſome vnaduiſed men, at the firſt broaching, as it were the morning thereof, till they haue found out y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poyſon. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it is a ſtinging doctrine tormenting the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers by an vncertaine hope of ſaluation, by fire of Purgatorie, by ſeeking heauen in their owne righteouſnes, &amp;c. Ninthly, <hi>And their power was to hurt men fiue moneths.</hi> The Romiſh Clergie is to do hurt, this is the end why they are, for they bee a plague of the fifth Trumpet. Theſe Locuſts had their time limited fiue moneths. Now this time is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1694:122"/> called fiue moneths, by a proportionable ſpeech fitting to the Locuſts, which liue the hotteſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the yeere; for a little cold either killeth them, or maketh them to lie as dead. Tenthly, <hi>They haue a king ouer them.</hi> Wherein though they differ from naturall Locuſts, Prou. 30. 27, yet doth this agree well with our popiſh Locuſts, who haue (Antichriſt) this Angel of the bottomleſſe pit ouer them, who as a Monarch and Soueraigne King, maketh lawes, preſcribes rules, orders, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to be without all exception obſerued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that great penaltie, euen the perill of mens ſoules; for he doth and will ſit, as God, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. 2. Theſſ. 2.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And they haue a king ouer them:</hi> This king is the ſame which before is called the ſtarre, for he is the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit: to the ſtarre fallen was giuen the key thereof, the Locuſts came out from vnder his authority, his vſing of the key brought them foorth; yea the pronoune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiue pointeth out that which was before, for the words are, <hi>That Angell,</hi> of the bottomleſſe pit: now hitherto no mention hath been made of any one hauing to doe with the pit, but the ſtarre. That ſtarres authoritie was for deſtruction, as the execution of it ſheweth, in opening the pit and letting out ſmoake to cauſe ſuch darkneſſe, and there-out ſuch Locuſts to come to doe ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; and therefore may by his authoritie ouer the Locuſts be their king, and by the euill thereof be well called <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi> deſtroyer. If any ſtumble at the Angell, chap. 20. 1, who hath the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1694:122"/> key of the bottomleſſe pit alſo, and ſhall thinke (perhaps) that he may be the king here. I anſwere, that that is a good Angel deſcending, not as this, falling from heauen: and he commeth to binde vp the Dragon from doing miſchiefe; but this king is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> a bad one indeed, a very deſtroyer, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon,</hi> euen as <hi>Apollo,</hi> the heathen Diuell of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſtarre and king is the Pope of Rome, and none other, in all things they agree. The Biſhop of Rome was a ſtarre in heauen, it cannot be denied, but is the ſtarre fallen, as before I haue proued, by his differing (yea contrary) doctrine to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the Church of Rome in his time. This ſtarre is become earthly, ſo the Pope; this got a key, ſo the Pope bragges of a key, though he would not haue it to be this key of the bottomleſſe pit, as it is indeede: a King alſo hee will bee; for what Churchman euer wore a Crowne, but he? or euer tooke vpon him to vſurpe authoritie ouer Kings, but he? He is a murtherer of ſoules, a murtherer of bodies, a deſtroyer of the Church of Chriſt, and an ouerthrower of his true worſhip; for the things (for which the next woe vnder the ſixth Trumpet came) noted in verſ. 20. 21, aroſe from this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſtarre, this helliſh king, (who hath power to commaund, and to doe what he liſt) and from his ſmoakie Locuſts.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. Heere is the next woe and terrible plague, from Chriſt, vpon the wicked idolatrous Antichriſtians. The iuſt cauſe of this great woe is ſet downe in verſ. 20. 21. a corporall puniſhment,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1694:123"/> after the ſpirituall, which was vnder the fifth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet; and thoſe two verſes ſhew againſt what kind of perſons this ſixth plague came out from Chriſt, for the good of his Church. This plague is the plague of <hi>Turciſme,</hi> following vpon the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Apoſtaſie. The words ſhew this to bee a plague of warre, the armie infinite, euen a Turkiſh power, as ſtories tell vs, raiſed vp to ſcourge a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; idolatrous people, and ſuch as did apoſtate from the true Church, by the wickedneſſe of the angell of the bottomleſſe pit, and his Locuſts.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Looſe:</hi> Therefore heere is neceſſarily implyed, that they were at liberty once, but reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till now, the word is ſo to be taken, chap. 20. 7. The ſtory of the Saracens and the Turkes, will ſhew this firſt liberty, then the reſtraint or bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and now liberty againe. <hi>Foure Angels:</hi> not diuels and euill ſpirits, though (no doubt) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels may be in ſuch inſtruments, but hereby <hi>men</hi> are to be vnderſtood; for this is a propheticall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of ſuch things as are to bee done heere by men; howſoeuer alſo diuels may be among them, and in them. Againe, theſe Angels are heads and chiefetaines of the armie, which were raiſed vp to fight, and by warre to kill men; therefore theſe muſt be iudged to be of the ſame nature that the armie is of; that by Angels may bee vnderſtood men, but ſuch men as are <hi>ſent out</hi> to execute Gods will, whether in good or in euill, is plaine in chap. 14. and 16. <hi>Foure:</hi> they are ſaid to be, not for ſuch a certaine number, either of chiefe heads, as ſome would haue them; for no ſuch certaine number can

                     <p>Verſ. 16. Two hundred thouſand thouſand, it is almoſt an innumerable multitude, as ſuch great numbers do imply, cap. 5. 11. Dan. 7. 10. The adding of <hi>Iohns</hi> hearing the number, is onely to ſhew that certainly, how incredible ſoeuer it ſeems to men, the armie ſhould bee exceeding great. <hi>Horſemen:</hi> theſe are onely named, becauſe they are the greateſt ſtrength of an armie; (not that the Turke commeth into the field onely with horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as wee well know) as alſo to note the ſwift courſe of the Turkiſh power, in their hoſtile inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, fierce and vnreſiſtable.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. A deſcription of the warlike expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this furious, and (as I may ſay) infernall hoſt. <hi>Horſes</hi> cannot here bee properly meant in the type, ſuch as wee call horſes properly; for there were neuer any of ſo monſtrous a ſhape as theſe,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1694:124"/> whoſe head ſhould be Lions, and their tailes like Serpents, with heads at the end. Theſe therefore type out not horſes themſelues, but by the <hi>horſes,</hi> a part put for the whole, is to be vnderſtood the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage and managing of the whole Turkiſh armie, and all war-like inſtruments, and hurtfull meanes, from the head to the taile, from the beginning to the ending. This Turkiſh power and forces therof, is likened to horſes, becauſe of the properties of horſes fitting thereunto (of which, in chap. 6. verſ. 2. before); they are ſtrong, Iob 39. 19. ſwift, Ier. 4. 13. careleſſe of any oppoſite, taking pleaſure in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, not turning backe without the riders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Iob 39. 22. And ſuch is the Turkiſh armie, ſtrong, ſwift, careleſſe of any enemies, yea taking delight in warre, neuer returning without their maſters command. The forefront thereof is like the heads of Lions, that is, fearfull and terrible to thoſe whom they come againſt, and of vndaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able courages, roring vpon the prey before them, which they are ready to deuoure. <hi>Fire, ſmoke,</hi> and <hi>brimſtone,</hi> proceeded out of their mouthes; this is called (verſ. 19.) their <hi>power to kill;</hi> ſo this ſheweth to vs their mercileſſe rage, as <hi>fire;</hi> their furie, as <hi>ſmoke;</hi> their cruell diſpoſition and readineſſe to be inflamed, to make an vtter deſolation, as <hi>brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton:</hi> poured vpon the places where they do come. For by fire, ſmoke, and brimſtone, is noted fearfull deſtruction, Geneſ. 19. 24. Iob. 18. 15. Pſalm. 18. 8. and 14. The middle of the hoſtile power differs nothing from the forepart; for ſuch as ſit vpon the horſes, that is, which be managers of this furious
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1694:124"/> raging and deſtroying hoſt, are armed with <hi>breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> of <hi>Iacinct,</hi> and of <hi>brimſtone. Iacinct</hi> is put for ſmoke, of which colour it is, omitting the name of ſmoke, as not ſo fit for the breſt-plate: for it is meet to haue in allegoricall ſpeeches, in euery part, a fit proportion of one thing with another: by naming only (of all the parts of armour) the breaſt-plate, which is before their breaſt and heart, it noteth their courage and prepared hearts, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with rage to deſtroy all things before them, as with fire and brimſtone, that the ſmoke thereof like Iacinct might aſcend vp; as at the ouerthrow of <hi>Sodome.</hi> So as the fire, ſmoke, and brimſtone, which came out of the horſes mouthes, is no other thing, but that deſolation, and mercileſſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by all warlike meanes, conceiued in the harts and breaſts of the Turkiſh commanders, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by them, to deuoure and conſume vp all where they come: of, and among which may the great Ordinance be reckoned, out of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth fire, ſmoke, and brimſtone, (gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being made of ſalt-peter, coles &amp; brim-ſtone), which deuouring Artillerie, tooke almoſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as ſome auouch) with theſe Turkes; as a means in Gods iuſtice, to further their helliſh rage, in the deſtruction of men. For of all inuentions for murthering of men, and to make a ſpeedy rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mens liues, the like was neuer found out; which inſtruments of death the Turkes doe vſe with a more furious will to kill without mercy, and to get into their hands what places they aſſault, then any other nation; making them ſo huge and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1694:125"/> great, as is beyond credit to report, ſuch as 70. oxen muſt draw one of them, and 2000. men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon, as the Turkiſh hiſtory doth ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>They had power in their tailes, which were like ſerpents, and had heads, and with them they doe hurt.</hi> By <hi>tayles,</hi> is meant the things that follow after, as tailes, which here are ſaid to haue power in them, which what elſe may it be, then the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and gouernment gotten ouer thoſe places, where this helliſh armie hath obtained victorie. It is baſe, therefore called <hi>tailes,</hi> for ſo the word is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for baſe and vile, Deut. 28. 13. 44. It is yet not without order, and ſuperiority, ſo <hi>heads</hi> are taken, Deut. 28. 13. 44. Eſay 9. 14. And laſtly, it is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>with them they hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe cannot be the popiſh clergie, which are vnder the fifth trumpet, noted by the locuſts: firſt, becauſe of the place <hi>Euphrates,</hi> whence theſe come, (verſ. 14.) farre from Rome. Secondly, for that theſe are a type of bloody, furious, and mercileſſe warriours, appointed to kill and ſlaughter men, verſ. 16-18. Thirdly, theſe are a corporall plague, to puniſh Idolaters, and other wicked men, verſ. 20. 21. whereas the Romiſh Clergie are a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all plague, and Idolaters, againſt whom this Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh power came forth.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Another mighty Angell:</hi> This is a type of Chriſt comming forth to comfort his Church;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1694:125"/> this appeareth to be ſo, from the place whence he came, by his clothing, crowne, face, feet, which are more glorious then can bee aſcribed to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This comming now of Chriſt ſheweth, how about this time he begun in more open manner to ſhew his care for his Churches ſafety. <hi>The rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> is here mentioned fitly, after a deluge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and miſeries, ſet out in the two former trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, as a generall deſtruction to the world. As <hi>Noahs</hi> flood was once, to ſhew that ſuch a deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould no more come vpon the world; for God by Chriſt was reconciled to his people, who now againe ſent them meanes, to recouer them out of that darkneſſe of Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie, into which men were plunged, and ſure to bee drowned, except the Lord would call them out of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>A little booke:</hi> The type of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and words of God. For this is that which Chriſts Miniſters muſt receiue, and preach vnto the people euery where, to gather them vnto him, verſ. 10. 11. <hi>Open:</hi> to ſhew that the booke of God ſhould now bee no more hidden, but bee made knowne vnto his people. <hi>And he ſet his right foot vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, and his left foot vpon the earth:</hi> Chriſt here commeth as an oppoſite to Antichriſt, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his kingdome, who aroſe out of the <hi>ſea,</hi> cap. 13. 1. and out of the earth, chap. 13. verſ. 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſets his feet of braſſe on both, to note his inuincible power, treading vpon his enemies, and ſubduing them, and to take, by this his booke, poſſeſſion of all places; for now would he raigne,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1694:126"/> and take to him the kingdomes of the world, as we may ſee in chap. 11. 15. in ſpite of Antichriſt and all his power.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And cried with a loud voice, as when a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on roreth:</hi> This ſheweth how Chriſt will haue his truth publiſhed with a loud voice, and with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as the roring of a Lion. He reuealeth (by this booke) his will, his voice is as the Lions roring, to worke feare; and thus ſpeaking, who can but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, Amos 3. 7. 8? Yea thus roring, ſheweth how he commeth with terror againſt his enemies, for his Churches ſafety, Eſa. 31. 4. for Chriſt heere is deſcribed according to his vertue working in his ſeruants, whoſe powerfull ſpeaking wil make ſeuen <hi>thunders</hi> vtter their voices. Theſe therfore are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſts voice, and are effects of it, in that place of Amos, chap. 3. (to which happily may be the alluſion, for any other agreeing hereunto, in any ſort, I find not) there is a reuealing of his will to his ſeruants, verſ. 7. to which this opened booke anſwereth: then there is the roring of the Lion, verſ. 8. ſo is there heere. Laſtly, vpon that roring there is a prophecying, and heere the voices of thunders, or thunders vttering voices; which type out prophecying, and reuealing of thoſe things written in this booke open in the Angels hand, which was to be receiued, to inable the Prophets to prophecie to peoples, nations, tongues, and Kings, as is ſaid in verſ. 11. The number of ſeuen, anſwerable to the ſeuen trumpets is noted, to ſhew, that now the Lord would begin to ſend out a plentifull meanes of inſtruction, to recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1694:126"/> his people from vnder Antichriſt; and the times from thence till now, ſhew vs, that hee hath ſo done. This miniſtery of the Goſpell, publiſhed by his faithfull ſeruants, is compared to the voyce of thunder. <hi>Firſt,</hi> for that it ſhall bee made to bee heard aboue all voices, as being the loudeſt, as the degrees of ſound of voices ſet out, cap. 19. 6. ſhew. No voice of multitudes, no voice of many waters, is ſo loud as the voice of thunde. As ſuch a voyce was needfull at the giuing of the Law, Exod. 19. to caſt downe all humane reaſon, and to cauſe men to ſubmit themſelues to the Lords will: ſo was it now, to beat downe mans carnal reaſon, now pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in the Antichriſtian ſtate, preſcribing rules of religion, and making a meere will-worſhip of ſeruice vnto God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe of the power of Gods word, being powerfull as thunder, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, (chap. 26. 14.) to ſtrike terror and feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens harts: hence <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> were <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> ſonnes of thunder, Mark. 3. 17. So was <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix,</hi> when he made him to tremble, Act. 24. 26. as mans hart doth at the thunder, Iob 37. 1. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe as the thunder of Gods power is not to be vnderſtood, Iob 26. 14: ſo the power of Gods word paſſeth all mens vnderſtanding, they cannot comprehend the reaſon of ſuch a mighty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying a power, as thunder, to bee in ſo weake meanes, in all outward appearance.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Scale vp theſe things:</hi> The Church here is told of ſeuen thunders, of which we are to take notice, for theſe are made knowne to vs, but now what they vttered, that is not written; <hi>Iohn</hi> heard
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1694:127"/> what was by them deliuered, for that he was about to write, as he receiued a commandement, chap. 1. 19. But here he was forbidden to write, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſeale vp theſe things, that is, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale them. Now why ſuch thunders ſhould bee, and the things vttered by them, not written and made knowne, may be, for that peraduenture, as in Dan. 8. 26. and 12. 9. the things were not now to be done: <hi>or</hi> for that they were not neceſſary; <hi>or</hi> not fit for mans reaſon to be vttered; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſome things reuealed to him in the third heauen. 2. Cor. 12. 4: <hi>or</hi> to ſhew that the things vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, were only to be knowne immediately by the voices of the thunders themſelues; God reſeruing the opening of mens hearts, and enlightening of mens minds by the word preached, vnto himſelfe; euen to make the things vttered, then to bee knowne, when the thundering power of the word was to be ſounded out, leſt it ſhould be deſpiſed: <hi>or</hi> for that here is ſet out the ſecrets of God, Amos 3. 7. and of his kingdome, Matth. 13. which is to be reuealed onely to them, to whom it is giuen to vnderſtand the ſame; for albeit powerfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Preachers be as thunder, euen vnto al, yet the things vttered are ſealed vp, except to thoſe, whom God ſhal pleaſe to make them known vnto.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>There ſhould be time no longer:</hi> that is, there ſhall be no more delay, or deferring off of time to finiſh the myſterie foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; the next verſe ioyned to this, plainly giueth this expoſition. It is not ſaid, that there ſhall be no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1694:127"/> more time (as if here he ſpake of the worlds end, as many doe ſuppoſe); but <hi>time ſhall be no longer,</hi> ſo ſpeaking, rather of ſhortening ſome time, then of a conſummation of all time. In the next place it is to be noted, how ſolemnly he ſweareth, which had bin needleſſe, if it were to be taken for the end of the world, which was both a knowne truth alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſufficiently confirmed in the hearts of all Gods people, for whoſe comfort hee taketh this oath. Thirdly, here is not a word of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of the finiſhing the myſtery of God, cap. 10. 7. for the fulfilling whereof the time ſhall no longer be deferred. Fourthly, in the time of the ſounding of the ſeuenth Angell, great and mighty matters muſt come to paſſe before the worlds end, as a great part of this booke, from chap. 14. ver. 14. to the end of the propheſie, foreſheweth.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>The myſterie of God:</hi> This <hi>myſtery</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken commonly for the day of iudgement, albeit we hardly find the laſt iudgement day to be called a myſtery, though our change and alteration then ſo ſuddenly be ſo called, 1. Cor. 15. 51. But here is ſpoken of ſuch a myſterie, as hath a beginning, a progreſſe, and a finiſhing: yea ſuch a myſtery, as by the meanes of this little booke, commeth to be finiſhed. The mentioning of this myſterie is here inſerted betweene the Angels bringing forth of this booke, and <hi>Iohns</hi> receiuing of it, verſ. 10. and therefore may ſeeme not to be vnderſtood of the laſt iudgement. It is taken by ſome for the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Iewes, which is called a myſtery, Rom. 11. 25. and may ſo well be, both for the hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1694:128"/> thereof, and the vnlikelihood thereof in all mens reaſon, ſo obſtinate are they. By it may bee vnderſtood, all and euery thing concerning Chriſts Church here vpon earth, of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue ſpoken, Chriſt himſelfe, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught, and this very propheticall hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth vnto vs; which Church and ſtate thereof is a myſtery from the very beginning, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting vp of the body of Chriſt, and ſo called, Epheſ. 3. 3. 4. 6. which place well noted, will tell vs, that the calling of the Gentiles is a myſtery, and ſo alſo the place in the Romans, chap. 11. verſ. 21. that the calling of the Iewes againe is a myſtery, ſo as Chriſt his Church and kingdome is nothing but a myſtery in the calling of the Gentiles, and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Thou muſt prophecie againe before many people, and nations, and tongues, and Kings: Iohn</hi> our Prophet here beareth vpon him the perſon of all faithfull Preachers of Gods word, ſent out by Chriſt, to preach. For theſe words cannot bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be performed in the very perſon of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but of ſuch as ſhould be raiſed vp by Chriſt, to prophecie, that is, to preach the holy word of God, <hi>To people, nations, tongues, and Kings:</hi> Which words ſhew, that the fallen <hi>Starre,</hi> chap. 9. 1. that Angell of the bottomleſſe pit, (verſ. 11.) and falſe prophet, (chap. 13. 11. 14.) and whore of Babylon, (chap. 17. 3. 15.) had now gotten theſe vnder his power, and helliſh iuriſdiction; from vnder which to recouer his owne, ſuch as were ordained to life, Chriſt Ieſus ſendeth his ſeruants, and that only by
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1694:128"/> preaching to regaine them; the effect and power whereof, wee haue found vpon people, nations, tongues, and Kings, who in Gods mercy haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpell, and haue renounced that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt the Pope of Rome, with all his vſurped po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, bleſſed be God.</p>

Theſe Prophets lie dead till the ſpirit of life enter into them, that is, till God raiſe vp other to defend the truth; which is here called the ſpace of three daies and a halfe, the whole time of bloudy perſecution, till there came to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeparation from Antichriſt. For theſe three daies and a halfe, is not the time of their prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but of the furious rage of the beaſt, and the triumph of his ſubiects ouer the ſeruants of Chriſt, vntill God had ſtirred vp other like them, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp in the ſight of their enemies, making a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeparation from them, the words in the text from verſe 7 to the 12, ſhew this.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>His taile:</hi> Dragons haue more force in their tailes, then in their iawes, ſo this figuratiue ſpeech is kept, fitting to the nature of a Dragon, for the ſignification of <hi>taile,</hi> and <hi>third part,</hi> ſee cap. 9. 18. 19. <hi>ſtarres of heauen;</hi> that is, Miniſters of the Church; <hi>and caſt them downe to the earth;</hi> an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Dan. 8. 10. that is, were made to leaue their ſtanding, and to forſake their profeſſion, by the rage of perſecution, and weakneſſe of their owne hearts, and to become earthly, like other men of the earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Dragon ſtood before the woman, &amp;c.</hi> This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth how the diuell, in, and by theſe Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperours diligently obſerueth the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches trauell; (as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Dragon of Egypt, Exod. 1. to which is the alluſion) that albeit her conceiuing, her trauell, and bringing forth, could not be preuented by him, yet he hoped to deuoure that which ſhould be borne.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>A man child:</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> was borne in ſpite of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to deliuer Gods people out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; ſo now the Chriſtian Church got a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a man-child; the like phraſe in Eſa. 66. 7. This commonly is vnderſtood of Chriſt; but we muſt remember, that <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth in this place a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall hiſtory of that, which the Chriſtian Church obtained for her outward helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; and likewiſe of things to come to paſſe after his time, and not of any common thing before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done. Further muſt bee obſerued, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whoſe originall <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, could be paſt, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1694:136"/> was to come. But if this birth was either of Chriſt perſonally, or of Chriſt myſtically, that is, of the begetting of him in mens hearts, by the preaching of the Goſpell, then it was of that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and not of that which was to come to paſſe afterwards. Moreouer, we do not ſay the Church trauelleth with Chriſt to bring him forth, as a ſon to her, which is her head and Soueraigne. S. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaith, Galath. 4. 19. that he (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) trauelled of the Galatians; but it is not ſaid that he trauelled of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of <hi>them;</hi> to forme Chriſt in them by his miniſtery: and yet vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly is this place fetched in hither, to make the Church to trauell of Chriſt. This <hi>man-child</hi> then is ſome potent Prince, as the next words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declare, who was to rule ouer all nations, with great power for the Churches good, whoſe ſonne indeed he was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who was to rule all nations, &amp;c.</hi> An alluſion to Pſalm. 2. 9. truly and moſt properly ſpoken of Chriſt; and therefore the reader heere moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceiueth Chriſt to be meant, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Chriſt beſtoweth this his power vpon his choſen ſeruants, chap. 2. 27. <hi>And her child was caught vp vnto God, and to his throne:</hi> Theſe words (which ſeeme to ſome, to make much to take this child for Chriſt) doe ſhew by circumſtances well obſerued, that it cannot be meant of him. For <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw Chriſt Ieſus before, chap. 1. and in the middeſt of the throne, chap. 5; hee had written in his Goſpell of Chriſts aſcenſion, and hee then had ſeene no wonder. Yea the ſo ſoone taking of him
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1694:137"/> vp from the woman to God immediately vpon his birth, without mentioning of his deeds, will not admit the meaning to be of Chriſt, of whoſe birth and aſcenſion <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh not one word in his prophecie: the very words themſelues are againſt it. <hi>Her ſonne:</hi> Chriſt is no where called the Churches ſonne, <hi>and ſo caught vp,</hi> an vnfit word to ſet out Chriſts aſcenſion, who is ſaid to <hi>goe vp</hi> Act. 1. 9. and <hi>to aſcend,</hi> as doing it of his owne power, and not as we, to be caught vp, 1. Theſ. 4. 17. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heere is no naming of heauen, (vſually mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned where Chriſts aſcenſion is ſpoken of) but of God and his throne, which as they are in heauen, whereinto Chriſt aſcended; ſo are they in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation to bee vnderſtood to bee heere in Gods Church, where, as in heauen, he ſetteth his throne, chap. 4. 2. <hi>Caught vp vnto God and his throne,</hi> may thus be interpreted, that now one of the ſonnes of the Church, a Chriſtian profeſſing Chriſt, was maruellouſly preſerued of God from the rage of Heathen tyrants, and exalted vnto Gods throne, that is, to be next the Lord in the higheſt place in his Church, the Prophets in the former chapter, chap. 11. 12. aſcended vp to heauen; but this child is taken vp to the throne in heauen, to rule next vnder God himſelfe, ouer the nations, that is, the enemies of the Church, with a rod of iron.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. The reaſon of her flying is verſ. 13. an alluſion to the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, who eſcaped from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that Dragon. <hi>They</hi> ſhould feed her; this relatiue <hi>they,</hi> hath relation to ſome perſons before, and that is to the two Prophets,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1694:137"/> chap. 11. 3. their time and hers agree, where daies are put for yeeres.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>In heauen:</hi> That is, in the Church; for in heauen properly taken, there could bee no ſuch fighting; neither was the diuell and his angels ſeene of <hi>Iohn</hi> in heauen, from whence they were caſt out from the worlds beginning. This warre followed vpon the birth of this child in the Church, that is, where Chriſt was publikely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; <hi>Michael,</hi> an alluſion to Dan. 10. 13. and 12. 1. He is Ieſus Chriſt, for hee is our Prince, as <hi>Daniel</hi> calleth him, chap. 10. 21. The child (as is before ſaid) cannot be Chriſt; for heere wee ſee is Chriſt fighting for his Church. But as the Dragon (the diuell) is not to be taken properly and alone for himſelfe, but by him muſt be vnderſtood the chiefe aduerſaries of the Church, the Romane Empire; and ſo by his angels, ſuch as bee inſtruments at their command to fight againſt Chriſt: ſo by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> muſt be ſo vnderſtood Chriſt, as alſo ſuch as be principal helpes for the Church; and by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, thoſe that are with them in defence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enemies to the Dragon.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Neither was their place any more in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:</hi> They did now beare no more ſway in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. The reaſon is here giuen, becauſe the Dragon and his angels were caſt out; ſo as it was not want of will, but want of power to withſtand <hi>Michael,</hi> and his ſeruants, that their place was no more in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Earth and ſea:</hi> The Dragon was caſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1694:138"/> from heauen; therefore earth and ſea are here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as places of his walking now without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: <hi>heauen</hi> is the true Church; <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>ſea,</hi> the bounds out of the true Church. For earth and ſea cannot be taken properly, for the godly are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters thereof, as well as the wicked, and they are the workmanſhip of God: and now the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> being taken for the Church, out of which the diuell is now ſaid to be caſt, the <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>ſea</hi> muſt be the places not accounted the true Church; but the places where the diuell hath power, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſway. <hi>The inhabiters of the earth and ſea,</hi> are in oppoſition to the dwellers in heauen, which are true profeſſors of Chriſt, and are his Church, of an heauenly conuerſation; and therefore thoſe which are not of the true Church, are ſaid to bee of the earth and ſea, being meere naturall men, ſauoring nothing of heauenly things; whether they be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, or ſuch as onely in name are Chriſtians, but indeed and truth, earthly Antichriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Two wings of a great Eagle:</hi> Hereby is meant means of protection to eſcape perill, Exod. 19. 4. and by a great Eagle, ſome mighty perſonage is deſigned, Ezech. 17. 3. 7. <hi>Wilderneſſe:</hi> this is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to popularity, viſibility, and outward glory; being a note of a retyred, hidden and poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, like to the ſtate of the teachers clothed in ſackcloth, chap. 11, 3. <hi>Into her place:</hi> ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was prepared for her of God. verſ. 6. <hi>A time, and times, and halfe a time:</hi> an alluſion to Dan. 7. 25. this is all one with 1260. daies, verſ. 6. for here, and there, is ſpoken of one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

                     <p>Verſ. 15. The Churches hidden condition made the Dragon, that hee could not now ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her as before by perſecution; therefore now <hi>he casteth out of his mouth water as a flood,</hi> this is his wrath ſpoken of, verſ. 12. <hi>Waters:</hi> are peoples, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, nations and tongues, chap. 17. 15. <hi>A floud of water,</hi> is the ſudden out-breaking of ſuch, and their violence mercileſly deſtroying all before<note place="margin">Eſa. 59. 19.

Whether this warre bee ſome other, or that which is mentioned in ca. 13. 7. I leaue to the godly learned to iudge of. It may ſeeme not to bee any warre of the Heathen againſt Chriſt and his Church, as the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon was; but the warre of the beaſt, chap. 11. 7. &amp; 13. 7. for this war is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the woman is fled into the wilderneſſe, and ſo in the time of the two Prophets prophecying; in which time is the beaſt warring againſt, not the Church in name, (for he and his Gentiles had the out-court, chap. 11. 2. and ſo would bee reputed to bee of the Church themſelues), but againſt thoſe that heere are called the remnant of her ſeed, and in chap. 13. 7. <hi>the Saints,</hi> ſuch as bee true Chriſtians, heere deſcribed; and ſo in chap. 14. 12. whom the beaſt and his Gentiles, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Chriſtians, doe hate as deadly, as the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon did Chriſt and his Church.

This cannot be properly vnderſtood of an Image or picture, as we commonly take the word <hi>Image;</hi> for this is an Image, which the inhabitants of the earth muſt make; this is then no caruers or ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers worke: ſuch an Image it muſt bee, as ſhould liue and ſpeake, and cauſe men to bee put to death that would not worſhip it. I haue before ſaid of this ſomewhat, in the third chapter, of this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue. The Beaſt, verſ. 1. is the Popedome, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt is the Pope and head in this Popedome, to which, by falſe doctrine and miracles hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth of them that dwell on the earth, an Image to be made, not an Image <hi>of him;</hi> for that beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue, and cured of the wound receiued, and this beaſt being in his preſence, ver. 12. it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to make an Image <hi>of him,</hi> whom all the world ſo beheld and followed after, verſ. 3. but an <hi>Image to him,</hi> that is, ſome repreſentation of high ſtate to vphold this Popedome: which Image all ſhould worſhip, in honour of the Popedome, hauing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make and ordaine lawes by the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (for he muſt giue life and ſpeech thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, elſe it is to be a dumbe Idoll, and may neither moue nor ſpeake without him, as the next verſe ſheweth) to all this new Roman ſtate. Let here the wiſe and learned iudge of this Image, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtories of the Popes, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church. Firſt, The Pope had not power to make it of himſelfe, but hee muſt get others to make it. Secondly, hee muſt cauſe it to bee made,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1694:145"/> not by force, but by ſorceries, and deceitfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Thirdly, this hee chiefly ſought to bring to paſſe, as without which he could doe nothing, and this by his wonders, and by his words, as the text ſheweth. Fourthly, hee obtained it at the hands of thoſe earthly Chriſtians. Fifthly, being made, it receiueth life and ſpeech from him that could not make it, and they that made it, had yet no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make it breathe, or ſpeake at all. Sixthly, this Image he vpheld, &amp; the worſhip and honour thereof with all his might, cauſing it to ſpeake, and to make as many as would not worſhip it, to be ſlaine. Seuenthly. This the faithfull oppoſe and preuaile againſt, chap. 15. 2. and 20. 4. which the wicked worldlings are ouercome with, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vnder Gods horrible plagues, cap. 14. 9-11.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Cauſed as many as would not worſhip the Image of the beast, ſhould be ſlaine:</hi> An alluſion to <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> tyrannie, Dan. 3. 6. 20. That which before was ſaid to be the Image <hi>to the beaſt,</hi> (becauſe it was for the honour of that ſtate to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, without which it could not haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) is here ſaid to be the Image <hi>of the beast;</hi> for that the Popedome now by the making of it, and the power thereof was (as it were) repreſented to all, adored and worſhipped, as Idolaters doe the Image of their God.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. The Pope hauing gotten this Image made, and thereby eſtabliſhed ſtrongly his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now hee vſurpeth authority ouer all, and brandeth them for his owne, as being their Lord and maſter: for it is ſaid, that now hee cauſeth all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1694:146"/> both <hi>ſmall and great, rich and poore, free and bond</hi> that is, all ſorts, of all orders and degrees, from the Emperour to the peſant, (ſo large and ample a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion hath he gotten) <hi>to receiue a marke;</hi> which was by this beaſt, or his inſtruments put vpon them, and they made as his ſubiects to receiue, for to diſtinguiſh them from others, and to be known to belong vnto (the beaſt) the Popes kingdome. <hi>A marke:</hi> the word is taken for a carued or a grauen worke, Act. 17. 29. but cannot ſo bee here, for the Popes ſubiects receiue no viſible or corporall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed marke vpon them. This marke is called <hi>the marke of the beaſt,</hi> chap. 16. 2. that is, the marke of the Popes, and Antichriſts dominion, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſtate; it is alſo called the <hi>marke of his name,</hi> chap. 14. 11. ſo that this marke is ſuch a thing, as maketh him that receiueth it, to bee one of that body and ſtate, for it is the <hi>marke of the beaſt.</hi> And the ſame perſon alſo thereby is cauſed to carrie the name of that beaſt and ſtate vpon him, for it is the <hi>marke of his name.</hi> So then this marke doth make him truly the Popes, in name &amp; ſubiection; it is (wee may ſee from the text) a marke of the whole ſtate; a marke bearing the name of that ſtate; a marke ſo neceſſary, and ſo generally fit for all, as the Pope cauſeth all ſorts to receiue it; a marke which Chriſts flocke eſcapeth, chap. 15. 2. and refuſeth to receiue. chap. 20. 4; a marke which who ſo willingly and wittingly receiueth, and not caſteth off, ſhall periſh, ca. 14. 11. Now this being a marke of the whole ſtate, and a marke of the name thereof; it is neceſſary before wee can know
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1694:146"/> the marke, to know the <hi>beaſt</hi> and his <hi>name</hi> firſt. The beaſt is not this ſecond beaſt, in verſ. 11. which is the very Antichriſt; but is the other firſt beaſt, verſ. 1. which is the Romane ſtate vnder the Pope, as is already declared: therefore this character is not the marke of the perſon of Antichriſt, the ſecond beaſt; but of his kingdome and ſtate, the firſt beaſt: neither therefore is the name a mans name, but the name of this ſtate; and not a name giuen of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, as they ſhall pleaſe to call it, but what Antichriſt the Pope, this ſecond beaſt, ſhall like and allow of; yea and ſo allow of, as they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, or the character of it, or the number of it, ſhall bee reſtrained of their liberty in common trafficke, verſ. 16. Now then this beaſts name, the Romiſh Antichriſtian dominion vnder the Pope, is (as they would haue it called and eſteemed) <hi>the Apoſtolike Church,</hi> or the <hi>Romane Catholi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">The Beaſts name.</note> This is the name of the Popedome, which the Pope (that Antichriſt) of Rome would haue giuen to it, and chalengeth as proper to his hierarchicall iuriſdiction, and to his emperiall ſtate; thus I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we haue the name. Now the marke of that Romane Catholike Church, or the marke of the name of the beaſt, of which all ſorts are capable, ſmall and great, rich and poore, free and bond; and therefore a common marke to any of them, which is <hi>Saint Peters keyes,</hi> branching out it ſelfe in euery<note place="margin">The Beaſts marke.</note> maine Antichriſtian doctrine, euery counterfeit ſacrament, idolatrous practice, ſuperſtitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, canon, or decree, contrary to Gods word, made and confirmed by the generall conſent and

Let none except againſt this, for that here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars are noted, when in text a marke ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly is mentioned; for they are all but bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Peters</hi> keyes, that one marke of that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vnlimited power of the beaſt, and euery one a marke of that ſtate, with theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concurring; that is, that it be a generall tenent of that Church; that it be contrary to Gods word; that it bee impoſed by the authority of that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church; that in ſubiection to the ſame it bee receiued, profeſſed, and practiſed. Hee that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo any one of the particulars, following with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the beaſt, and worſhipping his Image; (for that is to be preſuppoſed before he receiue the marke, as being impoſed by Antichriſt (as we here ſee) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſuch), he hath the marke of his name, is held by him one of his; and ſo wee alſo account euery ſuch a one to be a Papiſt, Romaniſt, or Romane Catholike.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>No man might buy or ſell:</hi> (Rome, or Romane dition, a trading place; all there, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) <hi>ſaue hee that had the marke, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</hi> The <hi>marke</hi> of his name is firſt, as being indeed the chiefe, and onely (as it were), maketh the proper ſubiects of that

This number of the beaſts name, is ſuch a number, as the Pope liketh well of; for whoſoeuer hath this number, is admitted to be among them, as well as they that haue the <hi>marke,</hi> and <hi>name:</hi> of all which he is the inuentor, hee cauſeth the Image to be made, he inuenteth the <hi>marke,</hi> hee giueth the <hi>name,</hi> and findeth out a <hi>number</hi> for the name of the beaſt; which at leaſt ſuch as haue not the marke or name muſt needes haue, or elſe not to come where hee hath to doe. What this number is, is ſhewed in the next verſe, for the number of the beaſt, and the number of his name is all one; as we ſee before the marke of the beaſt, and the marke of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1694:148"/> the name of the beaſt to be all one, cap. 14. 11. cap. 16. 2. both which (to wit, the marke and number) the faithfull eſcape from, chap. 15. 2. Therefore as in the Image and marke is impiety, ſo alſo in the number, though the perill be not ſo great to haue the number, as to worſhip the beaſt and his Image and to receiue his marke; becauſe theſe onely are ſeuerely threatened with dreadfull vengeance, chap. 14. 9. 10. 11. and not the other; yet is there euill enough in it, ſeeing it is part of the praiſes of the faithfull, that they get victory ouer the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beaſts name, chap. 15. 2. and that the Pope can like them ſo well, that haue this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; which therefore muſt alſo needs bee a thing knowne to him, and that which withall maketh thoſe openly known to him that haue it, that they thereby may be admitted to buy and ſell, as well as they that haue receiued the marke of the beaſt, and his name.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Heere is wiſedome:</hi> that is, heauenly wiſedome, for this is the wiſedome which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit commendeth, and here is required to the vnfolding of this point in hand. <hi>Let him that hath vnderſtanding count:</hi> Here men of vnderſtanding and endued with wiſedome, are ſtirred vp to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon and count the number of the beaſt, or the number of his name, which is all one. The beaſt is the firſt beaſt, and therfore the number of the beaſt is the number of that Romane ſtate vnder the Pope, or the number of the name of that ſtate, that is, the number of the Romane Catholicke Church, if that may be the name of the beaſt. <hi>For it is the

This being the expoſition, the words are brought in as a reaſon why it ſhould be ſaid, that <hi>here is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and why a man of vnderſtanding is needful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to count the number; euen becauſe of Antichriſt, that man of ſinne, his ſubtelty, in deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the beaſts number, or his names number, and this number of the beaſt, being the ſubtilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inuented number of a man, <hi>is ſixe hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſixe;</hi> which being a bare propounded number to a ſtate, and to the name thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning of times, perſons, or things, which by this might be numbred, (as to ſay 666. dayes, monethes, or yeeres, as wee ſee in all the numbers noted, in chap. 11. 3. and 9. 5. and chap. 12. 6. and chap. 20. 3; Or to ſay 666. perſons, as in cap. 5. 11. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1694:151"/> coniectures. The whole body and frame of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome is ſet out in this number 666. the beaſts number. This number runneth all on ſixe euery way; ſixe in vnities, in tens, and in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds. Now this number of <hi>ſixe,</hi> hath it perfection (of which <hi>Iunius</hi> hath written vpon this verſe at large) and is the firſt perfect number, of which <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface the eighth</hi> ſpeaketh, in the preface of the ſixth booke of the Decretals; which booke hee calleth the <hi>ſixth,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>a perfect number,</hi> and for that being added to the fiue other before, <hi>maketh the perfect volume, containing</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>a perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for the gouernment of affaires, and a perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, for the rule of good manners.</hi> Thus we ſee the Popes high account of this number of <hi>ſixe,</hi> of which this number of 666. conſiſteth, notably ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out this Antichriſtian kingdome. I. This number is a number of perfection, ſo that ſtate in their account, a moſt perfect ſtructure and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. II. This number, though it differ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from 6. to 60. and from 60. to 600. yet it holdeth in the perfect vnity, keeping the number of <hi>ſixe;</hi> ſo that ſtate hath degrees one greater then another, as much as 60. is a greater number then 6. and 600. greater then 60; yet keepe they all the number of ſixe, that is, as they call it, their vnitie both to their perfect head, their Pope, who, as they hold, cannot erre, and to his perfect decrees, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſects or ſchiſmes among them. III. The decrees in this number ariſe without any diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, by a like fit proportion in euery part of the number, from one degree to another. For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1694:151"/> looke what is betweene 6. and 60. the ſame, in the rule of multiplication, is betweene 60. and 600. So (as they make the world beleeue) in that ſtate in all the frame thereof, there is ſuch a comely order, and faire proportion, as might allure all men thereunto; if the parts bee conſidered from the loweſt to the higheſt, from their vnities to their tens, and from their tens to their hundreds. IV. This number in the degrees is raiſed by tens, from ſixe of vnities, to ſixe of hundreds, without which, this number ſo proportionally could not be raiſed. <hi>Ten</hi> is Gods number in giuing of his Lawes, Exod. 20. and <hi>Ten</hi> is his number, for the vpholding of his worſhip and ſeruice, performed by his ſeruants the Prieſts and Leuites, for their maintenance, Leuitic. 27. 30. 31. 32. So this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtate hath been raiſed vp from the ſixe of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that is, from their ſmal beginnings, vnder pretence of perfection (euen their number of ſix) to their ſixties, and ſixe hundreds, by tenths clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on Gods behalfe (but moſt vniuſtly) for the ſeruice and worſhip, which thoſe Antichriſtian Prieſts would ſeeme to performe vnto him. Thus wee ſee, how this number is the number of the beaſt, ſetting out the whole frame and body of that ſtate; this is the number which that ſecond beaſt (the Pope) liketh of; this is a knowne num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to all that haue any knowledge of that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtate; here alſo is wiſedome required: and by this which is ſaid, it may appeare, that this <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtandeth in the wel counting of this number, which is to finde it (for all this goodly accord, order, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1694:152"/> and pretence of pietie</hi> (all which are in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) <hi>to be onely the number of a man,</hi> that is, a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of a ſtate deuiſed by man, euen that man of ſinne. This is the number which the godly get vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie ouer, chap. 15. 2, and by counting the ſame, finde it a number without valuing of any thing; and ſo to be reiected as a number of nothing, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether differing from Gods number ſet downe in the next chapter, which is 144000, which at the firſt view may not ſeeme ſo proportionable a number as 666, in which yet there is no compariſon, this differing from that in three things. <hi>Firſt</hi> in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp of the <hi>building, Gods number riſeth on twelues,</hi> for this number 144000 is the number of twelue times twelue in chap. 7, to ſhew, that the Church and kingdome of Chriſt is raiſed vpon the doctrine of the twelue Apoſtles: therefore is euery part of the number at the firſt raiſed aboue twelue, declaring that nothing commeth into his Church to bee of account with God, till it come aboue twelue, that is, till it bee laid vpon the true foundation. The beaſts number beginneth <hi>before it come at twelue,</hi> of which number it cannot bee raiſed; that kingdome hath not the doctrine of the twelue Apoſtles to begin it with, or to raiſe it vpon; but indeed the inuentions of men and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions. Yet here note, that twelue may be found in this number, but neither the number in the foundation which is but ſixe, nor in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of the number by tens, but only in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber multiplied; as ten times ſixe, and ten times ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo is twelue to be often found, but this is ſecret
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1694:152"/> and hidden; to ſhew, that albeit that ſtate be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther built nor raiſed vpon the twelue Apoſtles doctrine, yet is it hidden for the elect ſake within that ſtate for their edification; or elſe it may bee found in the number by addition, as 6 and 6 doe make 12; where 12 is outward ſo and apparent, and yet but ſo once neither, to bee found in the whole number, and that by breaking of the order through addition, when otherwiſe there is onely numeration and multiplication. Teaching hereby this, that as in three 666 is outwardly but 12 once, and that by addition too; ſo that ſtate, though it haue within it often the number of twelue, that is, the doctrine of the Apoſtles hidden for the elect ſake; yet outwardly it hath it but once, that is, that doctrine is the leaſt part of the building of that ſtate, and alſo not to be found, but vpon the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the ſame, ſetting it out of the proper frame of it owne number and count. <hi>Secondly</hi> this number differeth from Gods number in the figure, for 144000 maketh by twelues a ſquare number of equall ſides, ſuch is the figure of the new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, chap. 21. 16, to ſhew the ſtable and vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate of the Church of Chriſt, holding in the building, and alſo in the figure and whole frame thereof, the Apoſtles doctrine; the number of <hi>ten</hi> is Gods nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber for the maintenance of his Church, but only the number of 12 to found it, proportion the parts, and to reare it vp. Now the beaſts num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cannot be made in full proportion ſquare, it is but a tottering ſtate, a kingdome that ſhall be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and periſh for euer. It is a ſtate that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1694:153"/> it hath a number, yet can it not endure the reed of Gods word to meaſure it by, as the Lords buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will, chap. 11. 1. and 21. 15; for they wel know, that it hath not the Apoſtles doctrine written in holy Scriptures for the foundation thereof. <hi>I hird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the beaſts number differs in this, that Gods number beginneth the firſt figure of valuation in the fourth place, the ſquare number, chap. 21. 16, and not at meere vnities, nor at tens, or hundreds; but at thouſands, and multiplieth into thouſands, ſhewing, that Gods Church beginneth in a ſolid communion and fellowſhip of many not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; and ſo increaſeth with the increaſing of God into thouſands of tens, and thouſands of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, though not into ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands (the Angels number, chap. 5. 11.) here in this life; for that is the perfection of their number with the Angels in the life to come. The Beaſts number beginneth at meere vnities, and aſcendeth to tens and hundreds; but neuer attaineth to the fourth place, the ſquare number, nor to the number of a thouſand, in this number here of 666, which is the figuratiue num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that ſtate, (though otherwiſe the world fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after the Beaſt), to ſhew, that the vnitie of that Church ariſeth not from the communion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny primarily, but by ſimple vnities or ones, that is, by the vpriſing of the Popes one after another; not in the fourth place of thouſands, a ſolid encreaſe, but by little and little to the certaine height, after which it ſhall alſo by little and little be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till it come downe againe vnto nothing. This
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1694:153"/> is the wiſedome giuen to count the beaſts num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which whoſoeuer can rightly count, will not at all make any account of that Antichriſtian ſtate, and Dragon-like dominion.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be asked, what reaſon there is of this, to ſet out this ſtate by a meere number ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to nothing that is numbred? This is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, to all that haue the wiſedome of God. It is ſet out firſt by a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, becauſe one day God will number it, for he hath written <hi>Mene</hi> ouer it, as hee did ouer <hi>Balſhazzars</hi> kingdome, and now hath begun to finiſh it, chap. 10. 7, and wil finiſh it, chap. 18; and it is (ſecondly) ſet out by a number without naming any thing that is numbred, to ſhew, that as ſuch a number is to no vſe, but to reckon, to ſee an order, to ſee a forme and a faſhion of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but without ſubſtance; ſo this Romiſh ſtate is vnuſefull to Chriſtianitie, and ſtandeth onely in a faire ſhew of order, in meere formes and faſhions, without ſubſtance of pietie. And indeed who ſeeth not, how that Antichriſtian Hierarchie ſtandeth more in forme and faſhion; in number of daies, in number of prayers, in number of orders, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeeres, for their antiquitie; in number of Councels, Fathers and others, for their conſent; in number of countries and kingdomes, people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tongues ſubiecting themſelues thereto, for their vniuerſalitie; then in any ſolid ſubſtance of true religion, holy &amp; ſincere worſhip, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teaching of the Apoſtles doctrine? But here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine may ſome demaund, why this number of 666 muſt be the Beaſts number rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

Or vnderſtanding this of the time of the Churches hidden eſtate, it noteth, that Chriſt ſtood vp, and by him and with him his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when all the reſt of the world fell downe and worſhipped the Beaſt. <hi>On mount Sion:</hi> An alluſion to the place where the Temple was built, here meant, the Church of God, Heb. 12. 22. 23. 24, euen the ſame which was called before, the Temple, cap. 11. 1. and the Woman in the wilderneſſe, chap. 12. 6. 14. and 144000 the ſame in chap. 7. the number of twelue times twelue. Of which before in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth chapter, and in the former chapter. <hi>His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name,</hi> called alſo the name of his God, chap. 3. 12. This no doubt was the marke they were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with in chap. 7: his fathers name is to bee <hi>their God,</hi> and to haue this <hi>written in their foreheads,</hi> (an alluſion to Exod. 28. 38.) is either to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant outward profeſſion of their faith in God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Chriſt, as that full notice might bee taken thereof: or it is their ſpiritual ſon-ſhip and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they had as certaine, as a thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and as euident teſtimonie thereof, as a marke in the foreheads, for children beare the fathers name: and this expoſition ſeemeth the better, for the <hi>name written in their foreheads</hi> is rather the act of another on them, as is ſhewed by the ſealing, chap. 7, then any act of their owne, as the former expoſition implieth. In this verſe, is the Lambe with his <hi>number</hi> alſo, and <hi>name</hi> and <hi>marke</hi> or <hi>ſeale,</hi> chap. 7. oppoſed to the Beaſts number, name and marke.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>From heauen:</hi> That is, the true Church
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1694:155"/> of God, the ſame in chap. 4. as appeareth here by the mentioning of the foure Beaſts, and foure and twentie Elders, which are ſaid to bee in heauen, that is, the true Church here vpon earth, chap. 4. 3. <hi>A voyce:</hi> This is the ſound of Gods word, for the voyce from the true Church is no other but Gods voice, for the true Church ſoundeth out only Gods word, as Chriſt commanded, Matth. 28. 18, and as the hiſtorie in the Acts doth ſhew, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles: now how commeth this voyce and word of God from the Church, but by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt? Therfore here is the ſound of Gods word preached by the meſſengers of Chriſt going out into the earth, ſet out in a three-fold degree thereof in the hearts of the hearers. The <hi>firſt</hi> is as <hi>the ſound of many waters,</hi> which is a mightie great voyce, but being a confuſed voyce teacheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinctly to the mindes of the hearers; it only worketh a wonder and admiration at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as Chriſts preaching did in many, Mar. 1. 22. 27. Matth. 7. 28. Luk. 4. 32. Ioh. 7. 46; but for want of diſtinct apprehenſion, it is only as a noiſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters to them, they doe learne nothing, yea the eares of ſuch become deafe many times with hearing at the length. Some expound theſe words (<hi>many waters</hi>) for the ſundrie ſorts of people, as in chap. 17. 15, <hi>but</hi> they conſider not the plaine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Here it is ſaid, <hi>the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1694:156"/> not a plainly expreſſed ſimilitude to illuſtrate the voyce by. Let the ſpeech of a plaine ſimilitude, and without ſuch a ſimilitude, be well obſerued in this booke of the Reader. The ſecond degree is, <hi>as the voyce of a great thunder,</hi> which is ſtrong and loud in the hearts of men, like the terror of Gods voyce in giuing of his Law; which in the conſciences of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men is ſo fearfull, as it maketh them to tremble as <hi>Felix,</hi> (Act. 24.) and to flie from the word, as not being able to heare the ſame. The third and laſt is, the <hi>voyce of harpers harping with their harpes,</hi> an alluſion to the ſweete melodie in the Temple at Ieruſalem. This is the effect of the word in the godly, which maketh them to take as it were harpes, inſtruments of praiſes, to become Harpers, ſpirituall Muſitians filled with ſweete peace and ioy of the holy Ghoſt, by the word of the Goſpell; in which the Saints accord, and with full concord of heart-ſtrings, as harp-ſtrings, from the comfortable promiſes of God, doe praiſe him melodiouſly.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And they ſung as it were a new ſong:</hi> Theſe words doe ſhew, that the former verſe is not to be vnderſtood of the voyce of the Church hidden in the Temple, and fled into the wilderneſſe; for the ſtate thereof affoorded not this <hi>new ſong,</hi> neither in that ſtate is the Church called <hi>Heauen,</hi> but when it commeth foorth to bee, in ſome ſort at leaſt, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo is heauen taken, chap. 12. 7. It is therefore to be vnderſtood of the Church breaking out, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two Prophets before ſlaine did aſcend vp, cap. 11. 12. Then ſang this Church this <hi>new ſong;</hi> for
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1694:156"/> in <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes a <hi>new ſong,</hi> is of new occaſions offered, and new matter of reioycing. <hi>Before the throne, &amp;c.</hi> See for this the Elders and beaſts, in the fourth chapter. <hi>And no man could learne that ſongue but the</hi> 144000. that is, none but the choſen number ſealed of God, and were his people, cap. 7. <hi>Which were redeemed from the earth:</hi> that is, from the falſe Church, and earthly ſtate of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Defiled with women:</hi> This ſpeech can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of marriage, as Papiſts would haue it; for marriage is honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled, Heb. 13. 4. and no where by Gods word called a defilement. If it were ſo, how could it be a Sacrament, as our enemies would haue it? The words may bee an alluſion to the Iſraelites, whereof many were inticed by the Midianitiſh women to Idolatry, Numb. 25. but many were kept from them, and from that ſinne againſt God: ſo this 144000; that is, all the faithfull and elect of Chriſt, when the Locuſts with womens haire, (ca. 9. 8.) thoſe effeminate inſtruments and ſpirituall adultereſſes for Antichriſt, enticed the world to worſhip the beaſt, and his Image, theſe were not defiled by them. Theſe women then are theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts of Antichriſt, and to be defiled with them, is to be corrupted by their doctrine, and idolatrous ſeruice, that which is plagued by the Turkes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, chap. 9. 20. for the text ſaith, <hi>theſe were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with women:</hi> as ſpeaking of that now which they had eſcaped, and were before in danger of; neither is it noted of one, or ſome of them, but that they all had eſcaped the pollution of theſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1694:157"/> women of the earthly Church, from which they were redeemed, when the foure Angels ſtood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foure corners thereof, holding the winds from blowing thereupon, chap. 7. 1. Theſe be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that earthly ſtate, from which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the inſpiration of Gods ſpirit, and to which the ſtarre fell, chap. 9. 1. The king of theſe woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Locuſts, with whom theſe 144000. haue not been defiled, in the words (cap. 7.) is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a ſpirituall preſeruation; and ſo here ver. 3. a ſpirituall redemption from the earth; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the 144000. were liuing vpon the earth, but in a ſpirituall ſafety in the Temple, chap. 11. 1. in the wilderneſſe, chap. 12. and on mount Sion here with Chriſt, verſ. 1. Therefore alſo here muſt bee vnderſtood a preſeruation from ſpirituall defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if women be here taken in the proper ſenſe, then muſt they be either honeſt women, or diſhoneſt; but to ſay that they were not defiled with honeſt women, is to imply an abſurdety and falſhood, that by honeſt wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and that either they inticed honeſt women to vncleanneſſe, or honeſt women them, which cannot be, if theſe be holy, and the women honeſt. To ſay they were not defiled by diſhoneſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is too meane a praiſe for theſe holy Saints with Chriſt on mount Sion; for here muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a ſingular praiſe of them in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but it were no rare praiſe in this, ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for that many Heathen, and meere ciuill men among Chriſtians, who neuer aſcended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mount Sion, neither were ſealed for Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1694:157"/> by the ſpirit of adoption, may haue this praiſe, that they were neuer defiled with diſhoneſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whores and harlots. Laſtly, note that this is the praiſe of the whole 144000. euen all the people of God, women as well as men; vnleſſe wee will ſay, that Gods number conſiſteth onely of men, and theſe alſo of the Clergie only, as they muſt needs be, if the Papiſts fooliſh conceit were true; and ſo all the laity excluded out of Chriſts flocke, which to thinke is moſt falſe, and a mercileſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to bee abhorred. <hi>For they are virgins:</hi> Pure worſhippers of God, and not hauing committed Idolatrie, or declined to crooked pathes, to bee corrupted in mind by Antichriſt or his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but haue ſtucke vnto Chriſt in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpell of truth, in the generall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie. In this caſe the Church is a chaſt virgin to Chriſt, 2.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 11. 2. and the whole company of the faithfull are called virgins, Pſal. 45. 14. <hi>Theſe are they which follow the Lambe, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>world</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after the beaſt, and worſhippeth him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth none but him for their head and guide. <hi>Theſe are redeemed from among men:</hi> before from the earth, now from among men. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the former; <hi>earth,</hi> being men in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, from which Chriſt tooke out his, and from which he yet calleth them, chap. 18. 4. <hi>The first fruits, &amp;c.</hi> An alluſion to the words of the Law; Deut. 18. 4. the high Prieſts due, ſo are theſe his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, the Lords portion.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>No guile:</hi> So like <hi>Nathanael</hi> true Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, not like the equiuocating Antichriſtian Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1694:158"/> Prieſts, Ieſuites, and our Church-papiſts, in whoſe mouthes guile enough is found. <hi>Without fault:</hi> They being accepted in Chriſt, and walking as <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in all the Lords waies blameleſly, Luk. 1. 6.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. Here is the breaking out of the light of the truth ſet out, in three degrees, in three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; three ſeuerall types of ſo many ſorts in the Miniſtery at that time, conteſting againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane beaſt. <hi>Another,</hi> in reſpect of that in cap. 8. 13. this being the next following, and not the ſame, though both flie in the middeſt of heauen, chap. 8. 13. that foretelling the euils to come vpon the earth, and this the comforts now to the Church. <hi>Angel,</hi> the type of the firſt ſort of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, meſſengers of Chriſt called Angels, Mal. 4. chap. 1. 20. and 2. 1. One repreſenteth all of the ſame ſort. <hi>Fly,</hi> noting the readineſſe and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the teachers, and the ſpeed they made in ſetting forth the truth, after God raiſed them vp, for it went abroad very ſwiftly at the firſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of the light. <hi>In the middeſt of heauen,</hi> ſee chap. 8. 13. Here alſo noting, that now it was not to be hindred by humane power vpon the earth; <hi>hauing the euerlaſting Goſpell:</hi> This ſheweth that the Angell was Chriſts Miniſters, for they preach the Goſpell, called <hi>euerlaſting,</hi> becauſe it was ſaid, cap. 11. 15. that Chriſt now was to raigne and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his enemies, and that by his word, which now ſhall for euer preuaile more and more againſt that man of ſinne, conſuming his kingdome, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the power and kingdome of Chriſt. The
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1694:158"/> Goſpell (in the time of Antichriſtian darkneſſe) did ſeeme to bee loſt, but now againe preached, ſhould be no more eclipſed. <hi>The</hi> euerlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, not <hi>an</hi> euerlaſting Goſpell, as ſhewing it to be no new Goſpell, but the ſame that was before, the enduring word for euer, 1. Pet. 1. 25. <hi>That dwell on the earth, and to euery nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Here beginneth that which was giuen <hi>Iohn</hi> in charge, chap. 10. 11. not to performe the charge in his perſon, as heere wee may ſee, but as a type of the Miniſters of the Goſpell, receiuing the charge which they heere now put in execution. This ſo large a commiſſion to preach, ſheweth the Goſpell was to bee againe ſpread ouer the dominion of Antichriſt, who had brought vnder him <hi>nations, &amp;c.</hi> chap. 13. 7. and 17. 1. 15. and the people of God, by the onely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel to bee recouered from vnder his power.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. The Sermon which hee preached, or the ſumme of that which was taught by theſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, raiſed vp at the firſt to vndermine the beaſts kingdome; they onely ſought to bring the people to the true knowledge of God, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was almoſt cleane put out by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. The true knowledge of God then, while he wholly raigned, was blotted out of mens minds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and his true worſhip troden vtterly vnder foote. Theſe two things are theſe firſt Miniſters ſent to repaire in the firſt place, as the only meanes indeed to vndermine Babylon, and to make it fall. The words are plaine and eaſie, as the common truthes in other Scriptures; onely note this in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1694:159"/> them, that what here men are exhorted vnto, that had been neglected, and the contrary done; no feare of God, but of men; no glory to God, but to the works and merits of men; no worſhip to him, but to ſtockes, ſtones, Angels, men departed, and ſo to diuels, chap. 9. 20.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Another Angell:</hi> A type of a ſecond ſort following vpon the reſt, by whoſe miniſtery (the ſumme whereof is here ſet downe) it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they ſaw the Popes kingdome by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels miniſtery, ſore ſhaken, and to begin to totter; therfore theſe plainly and certainly, by the doubling of the words, foretell the fall thereof. <hi>Babylon</hi> is heere ſpoken of, as a knowne thing by theſe Preachers, and yet no mention before, but of the beaſt, chap. 11. 7. and 13. 1. 7. It ſeemeth, that by the truth taught by the other Angell, Rome was diſcouered to bee no more the Church of Chriſt, but <hi>Babylon,</hi> which in chap. 17. 1. 2. &amp;c. is fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; the words here following, giuing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her fall, leade vs thither, ſee that 17. chapt. verſ. 2.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>The third Angell:</hi> The third type of Chriſts Miniſters ſetting themſelues againſt the Romane Beaſt, and his miſerable ſubiects. <hi>Saying with a loud voice:</hi> The degrees in proceeding is worthie noting; and withall, the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the buſines. The firſt teach plaine doctrine, and moſt neceſſary truthes, vndeniable of either ſide; and therefore doe it with a <hi>loud voice.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort (after the truth taught) begin to ſpeake directly and plainly againſt the ſtate of the beaſt,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1694:159"/> calling it Babylon, and foretelling the deſtruction thereof; but here is no mention of any <hi>loud voice,</hi> they doe their dutie faithfully, but yet more wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for awaking too much the bloody beaſt. This third (as the firſt ſort) dare bee ſtout <hi>with a loud voice,</hi> to denounce plagues againſt the ſubiects of Antichriſt for following of him. The denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moſt terrible, as the words ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in the 10. and 11. verſes: but yet note, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall vengeance is ſo ſeuerely threatened onely againſt them that worſhip the beaſt, and his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and receiue his marke, omitting them that haue his name, and the number of his name; not that they are not in danger, (ca. 18. 4.) but for that theſe are not ſo imbowelled (as I may ſay) in that ſtate as the other be, which know the deepneſſe of Satan, and are Antichriſts darlings. The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned are after, and according to the ſinne of that ſtate. They made others to drinke, ſo ſhall they bee made to drinke; others haue they burnt, ſo ſhall they be; others haue found no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at their hands, no more ſhall they at Gods hand.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. There be heere two ſentences in this verſe, which are vttered vpon the conſideration of the troubles and great perſecutions, which (vpon the forenamed Angels miniſtery) the beaſt ſhall raiſe vp againſt the Saints, ſet out in chap. 11. 7. and 17. 7. For theſe words heere, and in the next verſe, are to be referred to the troubles of thoſe times. <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints</hi> (vnderſtood) <hi>to be tried:</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſo furiouſly ſhall the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1694:160"/> beaſt rage, as it will trie the faith and patience of all the true ſeruants of Chriſt. <hi>Heere are they that keepe the commandements of God, and the faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (vnderſtand) <hi>to be knowne,</hi> for by ſuch fiery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution the chaffe and wheat ſhall be ſeuered, the droſſe from the pure gold.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. A conſolation to ſuch as ſhall be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ouercome of the beaſt, as it is ſaid, chap. 11. 7. and 13. 7. They ſhall be bleſſed. <hi>Henceforth,</hi> that is, as well in dying in this quarrell of Chriſts againſt the beaſt, as formerly they were bleſſed in dying againſt the Dragon; this is the meaning of <hi>henceforth.</hi> And this ſentence of comfort now was more neceſſary to be vttered then before; for men were put to death vnder the Dragon for profeſſing Chriſts name by the Heathen Tyrants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was there no doubt to be made of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and iuſt ſuffering and bleſſedneſſe after death: but now vnder the beaſt, though men die for the truth, yet ſhould they be condemned generally as Heretickes, by ſuch as ſhould beare the name of Chriſtians; yea and would alſo bee held the beſt Chriſtians too, the onely Apoſtolicke, the onely Catholicke Chriſtians, which might ſhake the faith of many, and make them forſake their place and ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. At the ſound of the ſeuenth trumpet, chap. 11. 15. great ioy was foretold to bee in the Church, for that Chriſt tooke vpon him then ſo to rule, and to ſubdue the beaſt and his ſubiects in that manner, as they ſhould thereat be wroth, verſ. 18. and therefore here in this verſe, which is to bee
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1694:160"/> annexed to that there, is Chriſt ſet out trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, through whoſe ſoueraigne power, is brought to paſſe by his inſtruments that which the ſecond Angell, verſ. 8. proclaimed, to wit, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Babylon, of the deſtruction whereof, and the vengeance now ready to bee executed, is a briefe ſumme laid downe from the beginning of this preſent verſe, to the end of this chapter. <hi>A white cloud:</hi> the ſpeech is from Eſa. 19. 1. In the chap. 20. and 11. verſe of this Prophecie, is a white throne; <hi>white,</hi> noteth cleerneſſe and purity, <hi>cloud,</hi> eminency and maieſty, as a throne, on which ſate, as Iudge, or rather as a kingly Soueraigne, <hi>one like the ſonne of man,</hi> which is Ieſus Chriſt, chap. 1. 13. <hi>on his head a golden crowne:</hi> this ſheweth, how hee was now inſtalled, and did take vpon him to rule, as in chap. 11. 15. is foreſhewed; for hitherto was he not ſet out with a crowne, whileſt hee ſuffered others to rule and raigne. <hi>And in his hand a ſharpe ſickle.</hi> A <hi>ſickle</hi> among the Iewes (to whoſe cuſtomes in this prophecie euery where the ſpirit alludeth) was an inſtrument to cut downe corne, Deut. 16. 9. and 23. 25. and the branches of the grapes, Eſa. 18. 5. The Hebrew word there, is the ſame that is tranſlated ſickle here. It is heere figuratiuely put for the meanes of ready and ſharpe vengeance, which Chriſt will vſe to cut off the wicked with, as the reapers doe the corne, off from the earth with a ſickle.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. Chriſt being ready prepared to take vengeance, which he had (chap. 6. 11.) hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but now the time being come, here <hi>another
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1694:161"/> Angell,</hi> beſides the three former in verſ. 6. 8. 9.—<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of the Temple,</hi> of which in chap. 11. 1, thoſe in the Temple were the true Saints and ſeruants of Chriſt, as appeareth chap. 7. 15. and thoſe alſo that were the hidden ſealed number with the Lambe on Mount Sion in verſ. 1 of this Chapter. Therefore this Angel is a type of the faithful ones, renewing the ſuite of the ſoules vnder the Altar, (chap. 16. 11.) that God would execute vengeance vpon the earth. And is ſaid to come out of the Temple, as being now by the miniſterie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels imboldened to come abroad, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to make prayers and earneſt requeſt vnto Chriſt to proceed againſt that Antichriſtian ſtate. <hi>Thruſt in thy ſickle:</hi> The words are from Ioel. 3. 13. <hi>Reaping,</hi> is here put for cutting off the wicked. <hi>The harueſt of the earth is ripe:</hi> The harueſt ripe, is the fit time of vengeance not to be deferred, Ier. 51. 33. <hi>Of the earth:</hi> That is, of the falſe Church or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſtate; for of this here is ſpoken, as all that before from the beginning of the 13 chapt. hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the chapters following ſhew. The <hi>Earth</hi> is the place where the beaſt ruleth, chap. 13. 8, out of which the counterfeit Lambe commeth, in the ſame chap. 13. verſ. 11: and they that dwell on the earth now to be reaped, are the Antichriſtians, the worſhippers of the beaſt and makers of his image, verſ. 14. of that 13. chapter.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. The requeſt granted, and by the thing ſucceſſiuely executed, a riddance was made of the falſe Church.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. The words in this chapter from verſ. 14
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1694:161"/> to the end, ſetting foorth ſummarily the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment executed vpon the falſe Church, the Spirit doth it by a double ſimilitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one, by reaping of the harueſt; the other, by the gathering of the Vintage. In the former, Chriſt himſelfe at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſupplication and prayers of the Church is made the Actor, ſhewing (as I conceiue) that there ſhall be two degrees of this vengeance; the one (like the reaping of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harueſt) more eaſily done by men, yea the deſtruction ſhal come vpon the beaſt and his ſtate with ſo little violence and force on mans behalfe, as all may behold the immediate hand of Chriſt himſelfe, obtained by the prayers of his people. And indeed ſo hath it been hitherto in the downfall of the Popedome by the power of Chriſt, and almoſt no power of man at al, but done as eaſily as a ſickle cuts downe corne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee the plagues and iudgements vpon the beaſt to bee aſcribed vnto the Lord, chap. 16. 5. 7. and the enemies took it to be his very hand (ver. 9) in the firſt ſorts of plagues. In the latter ſet out by the vintage. <hi>Another Angell,</hi> that is, a type of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Chriſts comming from among the faithfull out of the <hi>Temple in heauen,</hi> that is, from thoſe of the hidden number conſtantly faithfull now in the viſible aſſembly, <hi>hauing alſo a ſharp ſickle,</hi> that is, being appointed in Chriſts ſtead to auenge his quarrell, into whoſe hands he had put the ſickle, that is, <hi>effectuall meanes,</hi> to execute his wrath vpon the Antichriſtian ſtate; ſo as now he will work the deſtruction thereof by men in a more apparent and forcible manner, then afore had been done,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1694:162"/> that is, by ſword, warre, and bloud, typed out by the figuratiue ſpeeches heere drawne from the Wine-preſſe, this is the ſecond degree of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. The firſt of the harueſt being ſet out in the fiue firſt vials, chap. 16. 1. 11. and this of warre and bloudſhed, ſet out in the ſixth and ſeuenth viall, chap. 16. 12. 17. and 17. 16. and chap. 18. &amp; chap. 19. In all which what is meant by this wine-preſſe, and by this bloud running out thereof, is fully expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 18. The former Angell is a type of thoſe inſtruments, which the Lord will prepare to this his buſineſſe, which ſhall performe the ſame, as verſ. 19—ſheweth; but yet muſt firſt ſome be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Lord to encourage them thereunto. <hi>Another Angell,</hi> a type of faithfull Paſtors, who is ſaid to <hi>come out from the Altar,</hi> for that they were ſtirred vp in the cauſe of the Saints ſlaine and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder the Altar, (chap. 6. 9.) to ſtirre vp others to auenge their quarrell; as alſo to ſhew that they came with authoritie from Chriſt, who had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his ſacrifice vpon the Altar peace with God for his elected ones, and that now their cauſe might be reuenged. <hi>Which had power ouer fire:</hi> To haue power ouer any thing what is it els, but to be able to reſtraine that thing, and to haue it at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund? <hi>Fire</hi> is put for <hi>vehement contention,</hi> Iudg. 9. 20. Ouer this had this Angell great power, that is, God by his miniſterie wrought ſo, as peace was among Proteſtant Princes, and ſuch as were to riſe vp againſt the beaſt; God was reconciled to them, and they among themſelues. This Angell is the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1694:162"/> type of thoſe faithfull Paſtors, who now therefore <hi>cried with a loud crie,</hi> that is, with all vehemencie of ſpirit and boldly without feare; and exhorted the Angell with the ſharp ſickle, that is, thoſe that they ſaw made fit inſtruments by Chriſt, to fall to the execution, which is the thruſting in of the ſickle or hooke. <hi>Vine</hi> is a Church: <hi>of the earth,</hi> the falſe Church: <hi>Cluſters,</hi> the diſtinct orders, ſocieties, and brotherhoods of the ſame: <hi>to gather them,</hi> is to take them away: <hi>grapes,</hi> the fruites of that Church; <hi>fully ripe,</hi> is (as it was ſaid of the Amorites) their ſinnes come to the height, and may now no longer be forborne and paſſed ouer.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 19. The execution, according to the word of exhortation and proſperous ſucceſſe thereof; <hi>gathered the vine,</hi> not onely the cluſters and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but Babylon her ſelfe is deſtroyed, chap. 18. <hi>Caſt into the great wine-preſſe of the wrath of God.</hi> The words taken from the Iewes cuſtome, who had a wine-preſſe readie, when they had gathered the grapes to caſt them into. Theſe words ſhew this Angell to be the type of the inſtrument of Gods wrath againſt the Antichriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 20. The ſimilitude is followed; for when grapes are caſt into the wine-preſſe, then are they troden, Iudg. 9. 27, and the iuyce of them runneth out of the ſame, Nehem. 13. 15. Eſai. 63. 3. 4: <hi>The wine-preſſe</hi> is the place, where the Antichriſtians are troden downe: <hi>without the Citie,</hi> as did the Iewes tread their wine-preſſes without Ieruſalem. This noteth the true Church to bee without danger, when this ſlaughter ſhall be made of the enemies.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1694:163"/> 
                        <hi>And bloud came out of the wine-preſſe euen vnto the horſe-bridles:</hi> Theſe words and the other following, are to expreſſe the greatnes of the ſlaughter of an exceeding multitude of enemies, as chap. 16. 14, and 19. 18 ſhew: for I ſuppoſe heere to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that battell, which ſhould make ſuch a ſlaughter of them, as that Chriſt is ſaid to weare a garment, after the ouerthrow of theſe enemies, dipt in bloud, chap. 19. 13. <hi>By a thouſand and ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs,</hi> Thus farre the bloud muſt runne: as the vine, the wine-preſſe, and manner of treading out the grapes, is an alluſion to the cuſtome of the Iewes, and the Citie to Ieruſalem; ſo theſe words are an alluſion to the length of the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, which, as ſome write, is 1600 furlongs; which was, as it were ſpread ouer with bloud, being made the Lords wine-preſſe of his wrath once by the hand of the enemie, whether we vnderſtand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that nation by the Chaldeans, or after by the Romans.</p>

Theſe words ſhew, in what ſtate the Church was now at this preſent come vnto, before the pouring out of thoſe vials, vpon the preaching of the three Angels, in chap. 14. 6. 8. 9.

For by conſidering what is there ſaid, and here repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe after ſo long an interruption, all may ſee, that here is a falling-in vnto the ſame matter there left to bee ſpoken of, till this place. By which will appeare moſt plainly, how the ſeuenth ſeale hath the ſeuen trumpets, and the ſeuenth trumpet theſe ſeuen vials. <hi>The Temple of the tabernacle of the teſtimonie:</hi> Words of alluſion vſuall and common to the time of the Law. The <hi>Temple,</hi> the inmoſt place of the tabernacle, as hath been ſhewed, chap. 11. 19, where (as there is declared) was the Arke, 1. King. 8. 6, and in it the two tables of ſtone, which are the teſtimonie; becauſe of the Law written in them, which teſtified the will of God: ſo the <hi>two tables</hi> are called the <hi>teſtimonie,</hi> Exod. 25. 21: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were put in the Arke, it is called <hi>the Arke of the teſtimonie,</hi> verſ. 22, and for that the Arke was in the inmoſt part of the tabernacle, that part is called the <hi>tabernacle of witneſſe,</hi> Numb. 17. 7. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two Prophets were aſcended vp, chap. 11. 12, and that now the Church became viſible, the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is, the hidden things of God formerly vnknowne, became now to bee manifeſt by thoſe Angels, (cap. 14. 6. 8. 9.) who taught what this true teſtimonie of God was vnto the people. <hi>In heauen,</hi> that is, in the true viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1694:164"/>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>The ſeuen Angels</hi> (mentioned before in verſ. 1.) <hi>came out of the Temple;</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is, that part of it where the Arke was, the place where God gaue anſwere to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> of all things hee would haue done, Exod. 25. 22. Leuit. 7. 89. Numb. 17. 4. This ſheweth, that theſe had their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and commaund from God to come forth, and were of his choſen ones raiſed vp to execute vengeance vpon the Pope, vpon the Papiſts, and vpon their Romiſh ſtate, as chap. 16. verſ. 1. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainly. <hi>Hauing the ſeuen plagues:</hi> How they had them, the next verſe telleth vs. <hi>Clothed in pure and white liuen, and hauing their breaſts girded with a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den girdle,</hi> as Chriſt was, chap. 1. 13. An alluſion to the Prieſts habit miniſtring in the Tabernacle, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus 28. 40. 42. Leuit. 16. 2. This is to ſhew, what manner of perſons they were, and how qualified, whom God thus appointed to execute his will. They were of thoſe that were of the true ſocietie and temple of the holy Ghoſt, Prieſts by Chriſt, hauing pure and white linen, the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, (chap. 19. 8.) ready prepared to do their office: <hi>girding</hi> noteth care and diligence bent to performe what is impoſed, and they reſolued to doe without impediment, Exod. 12. 11. 1. King. 18. 46. Luk. 12. 35. <hi>A girdle of gold,</hi> (which was alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſt) is righteouſnes and faithfulnes, Eſai. 11. 5. By the way then (for this one time) heere note, that they which are lewd and vicious, though neuer ſo wiſe, politique, rich, and valiant, ſhall not be Gods inſtruments to plague Antichriſt and his kingdome. This their Prieſtly apparell ſheweth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1694:165"/> alſo how that theſe Angels come forth in the Churches cauſe, and for her ſake, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by and ſiniſter reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. Here is ſhewed, by whom they were furniſhed with theſe ſeuen laſt plagues, that is, the ſeuen vials, and of whom they did receiue them: <hi>And one of the foure beaſts:</hi> What the beaſts bee, is ſhewed (chap. 4. 6.) euen Eccleſiaſticall perſons, which of the foure it is, is not here noted, as being a conioynt act of them all, the deed of one, as well as of another. <hi>Gaue vnto the ſeuen Angels, ſeuen gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vials.</hi> The inſtruments containing the plagues are here compared to cups, or bowles, holy veſſels of the Tabernacle made of pure gold, Exod. 25. 29. and 37. 16. Ier. 52. 19. A viall is a cup with a big bellie, and a narrow mouth, ſo as that which it containeth, is poured out by leiſure, and not all (as it were) at once, as out of cuppes with wide mouthes. That which is in them is <hi>Gods wrath,</hi> of which they are <hi>full;</hi> for as the grapes were <hi>full ripe,</hi> (chap. 14. 18.) ſo heere bee the cups <hi>full of wrath.</hi> Which is ſaid to be in vials; firſt, for that Gods iudgments are prepared, vnſeene to the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate, and not diſcerned till they fall vpon them: alſo, becauſe theſe plagues are executed by the ſeruants of Chriſt vpon the enemies with no difficulty, euen as eaſily as licour is poured out of a veſſell, and that without noiſe, tumultuous ſtirs, and hurli-burlies on their part. <hi>Of gold they bee,</hi> for that Gods wrath is iuſt, pure, and vncorrupt. <hi>And giuen of one of the beaſts:</hi> To ſhew, that theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that is, men, appointed by God, were furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1694:165"/> hereunto from the Miniſters of Chriſt, by doctrine and inſtruction, for other vials haue they none to giue. God himſelfe calleth out theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; that is, qualifieth them with gifts, power, and place to execute his will. The Miniſters of God they teach the truth of religion, the doctrine and diſcipline of Chriſt, the vnſufferable ſtate of Antichriſt, his Idolatrie, falſe worſhip, hereticall doctrine, tyrannicall gouernment, his proud vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped power ouer Kings, his trecheries and treaſons to vphold the ſame; and ſo doe vrge theſe Angels by the word of exhortation, the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the ſafety of his Church, and welfare to themſelues and all Gods people, to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for the Lord, and againſt that Antichriſtian ſtate: which miniſtery the Lord bleſſing, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby into the hearts of theſe Angels to do ſuch things, as may annoy, and at length ruinate that ſtate, they hereby may bee ſaid to giue theſe vials of Gods wrath into their hands. This is my gueſſe of this, how true this interpretation is, I leaue it to be iudged; the ground of my conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is, that theſe words cannot bee taken literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Miniſters haue not any materiall cups full of Gods wrath, and the effects of pouring out the vials, ſhew, that the plagues are not any way to be vnderſtood after the letter; for we reade not of any ſuch thing done in any ſtory in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. When men giue any thing, wee know it is that which they haue, and termes of ſuch things muſt be interpreted according to the nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and place of the giuer, as it may bee moſt

The plagues of theſe vials by degrees doe anſwere the trumpets, that looke how Antichriſt by his riſing, was a plague to the Chriſtian world; ſo in like manner theſe plagues light vpon him, from the loweſt to the higheſt, as in the following verſes ſhall bee ſhewed.</p>

Here muſt be a plague vpon the Roman and Antichriſtian kingdome, effected by ſuch as the Lord raiſeth, comming out of the Temple, and it muſt be an anſwerable reuenge for the euill, which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Antichriſt in his riſing brought vpon the Chriſtian world, noted in cap. 8. 8.

                        <hi>ſea</hi> (taken litterally) done to Gods people, by the Popes means, in his creeping vp? &amp; what reuenge is it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches behalfe to plague the ſea? It is a moſt abſurd apprehenſion to take it litterally, &amp; moſt falſe. For neuer ſuch a thing euer was: who euer heard that the ſea hath bin as the blood of a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that all the fiſhes died ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Or who can imagine euer any ſuch thing here foretold to come to paſſe hereafter? Neither can it be vnderſtood of battels fought by ſea. This is a <hi>ſea,</hi> which muſt become as the blood of a dead man, thicke, blacke, and lothſome; and here is no ſpeaking of men dead vpon the ſea, but of euery liuing thing in the ſea; that is, euen euery ſoule maintained by the ſea to liue, as the fiſhes natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in the waters of the ſea. To take vp the true ſenſe and meaning of this plague, three things are to be well weighed. I. What is meant heere by the <hi>ſea?</hi> II. How by any of the true Church of Chriſt, (ſuch as come out of the Temple) it can be made like the blood of a dead man? III. How euery liuing thing hereupon dyeth in that Sea?
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1694:168"/> My coniecture is this, that as <hi>earth</hi> ſets out the wealth, riches, reuenewes, and poſſeſſions of that ſtate, vpon which the firſt viall was poured; ſo by <hi>Sea,</hi> (another thing of that ſtate, and the next vnto the earth to be conſidered of) is meant the Popes eccleſiaſticall lawes, Church-ſeruice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worſhip; a ſea of euils, of a ſalt and briniſh taſt to all Gods people, in which none can liue, which haue drunke ſoundly of the ſweet and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waters of life.

                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>The 4. Angell:</hi> That is, the 4. ſort of Gods inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts types out in this one, <hi>poured out his vial</hi> wee haue heard, in chap. 15. 7. was full of Gods wrath, which is poured here <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sun.</hi> This is the 4. degree of the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt, anſwering to the like degree in riſing, ſet downe in cap. 8. 12. This <hi>Sun</hi> is a part of the Antichriſtian Kingdome, as the reſt before were. This point muſt be well marked, that here the Antichriſtian ſtate is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by degrees, in the parts therof beginning with the <hi>earth</hi> of it, then with the <hi>ſea</hi> of it, next with the <hi>Riuers and fountaines</hi> of it, and now with the <hi>Sun</hi> of it, that is, with that part or portion of it, which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1694:170"/> is as the ſunne in that ſtate. This cannot bee the <hi>ſunne</hi> properly, as ſome would haue it; for what man can ſmite the ſunne, or poure a viall vpon it? And againe, how can the Church (if any one ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could doe it) make the ſunne in the firmament hurtfull to the Papiſts, and not alſo to themſelues? It cannot bee the light of the Goſpell, and holy Scriptures, as other conceiue it; for they are no part of the Antichriſtian Kingdome, as this <hi>ſunne</hi> is. And it is too groſſe to ſay, that the viall, that is, the plague of God is poured by the friends of the Goſpell, vpon the light of the Goſpell, or vpon the holy Scriptures, therewith to plague the enemies of the Goſpell, as this viall poured vpon this ſunne muſt. Here the true Church of God, in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof appointed by God, is to poure out a viall, (not throw vp a viall, as it ſhould haue bin ſaid, if it were the ſunne properly) vpon the <hi>ſunne</hi> of that ſtate; ſuch a ſunne, as the appointed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Church may reach vnto, and in ſome ſort be ouer, to poure the viall vpon it. Now in that ſtate, what is ſo like the <hi>ſunne</hi> for glory and for brightneſſe, to cauſe that falſe Church ſo to ſhine, (as the ſunne in the firmament lighteneth the world) but only the Popes ſupremacie? which in that earthly orbe ſupplieth the office of the <hi>ſun,</hi> to that ſtate, as the glorious light of heauen doth to this earth wee tread vpon. The pouring of the viall receiued from one of the beaſts, (chap. 15. 7.) vpon this ſunne, what can it bee elſe, but Princes receiuing this doctrine of truth, that that ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie is an Antichriſtian vſurpation, and ſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1694:170"/> begin to enact lawes vpon extreame perill againſt it; and alſo to ſet vp the lawfull ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Kings, Gods vicegerents in their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, to make men to ſweare thereunto; and in deteſtation of that Antichriſtian pride of the Pope (lifting vp himſelfe aboue al that is called God) to proclaime him openly to bee heerein that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? By which this Angell, that is, theſe Princes and Potentates haue ſcorched the Pope and his men with fire; that is, made them burne with the rage of impatiencie ſo, as they blaſpheme euen God himſelfe, as the next words in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing doe ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>And they were ſcorched with great heate:</hi> That is, they were inraged in their harts with ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and malice, as with a burning fire. <hi>And blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the name of God:</hi> euen as the beaſt doth, ca. 13. 6. For that ſtate of Rome now vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his ſubiects, are blaſphemers of God. And doe not we here in England find this true in their writings and ſpeeches? They ſpare not the workes of God, his immediate hand for vs, (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their Spaniſh Armado, in diſcouering their Gun-powder plot, and ouerthrowing them in all their trecherous, treaſonable, and rebellious attempts) ſaying, that it is by the helpe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; a helliſh blaſphemie! they ſpare not to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his holy word, his worſhip, doctrine, and ſacraments with vs; ſo inflamed with furie are they, when their Pope is challenged for that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, in his proud and tyrannicall ſupremacie. Behold their heart ſcorched with heate, in their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1694:171"/> fierie malice againſt our Soueraigne, for his moſt rare and admirable Apologie; ſent out to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings, Princes, and States of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, touching this particular point. Thus farre I ſuppoſe the Lord hath executed his wrath in all theſe foure degrees, vpon the preſent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Romiſh ſtate; the euents ſeeme fully to prooue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>The fifth Angell:</hi> That is, the fifth ſort of choſen inſtruments typed out by this, <hi>poured out his viall vpon the ſeat of the beaſt.</hi> This is the fifth degree of his ruine, anſwering the fifth trumpet, and to the Popes earthly vpriſing, in his falling from heauen, and becomming the king of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts; for there is he called a king, chap. 9. 11. and heere is attributed to him a kingdome; and as there was darkneſſe, ſo heere; and as the Locuſts did torment men, ſo heere now are they againe tormented. <hi>His ſeate</hi> is Rome, chapt. 13. 2. vpon this muſt wrath come by the <hi>Angels out of the Temple,</hi> and then that Popedome <hi>ſhall bee full of darkneſſe,</hi> that is, full of miſerie; whereupon ſhall follow their deſperate ſorrow, expreſſed in theſe termes, <hi>they ſhall gnaw their tongues for paine;</hi> and yet continue obſtinate, blaſpheming without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, verſ. 11. This viall is not yet poured forth, but is next in order, and not long to; let Rome ſee to it, and Gods people come out of her.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And the ſixth Angell poured out his viall vpon the great riuer Euphrates:</hi> This anſwereth to the ſixth trumpet, chap. 9. 14, where out of the riuer
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1694:171"/> came foure Angels to plague the world; this is now here to be dried vp for a plague to Antichriſt, and is an alluſion to the drying vp of the riuer, before the winning and deſtruction of Babylon, of which <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 51. 32. From this verſe to the end of the chapter, it is of things to come; and prophecies are beſt knowne when they are fulfilled. I will therefore intreate the Reader, if he be deſirous to know what men coniecture here, to looke vpon the labours of others, eſpecially thoſe that haue written the very lateſt, who declare their minde to the full, and perhaps truly too; the euent which wee muſt expect will ſhew it in time; I for my part will onely ſet downe, according as in the text is deliuered, what we are to obſerue and looke for to come to paſſe. By <hi>Euphrates,</hi> an alluſion to the riuer of Babylon, is meant lets withholding to come at that myſtical Babylon, mentioned in verſ. 19, vpon which, the viall, that is, a iudgement, is poured; which is here called the drying vp of the waters thereof, that is, the remouing of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, and ſo making a way for the Kings of the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. The beſtirring of the inſtruments of the Romiſh Church foretell vs, that the drying of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the prepared way for the Kings, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſtate, &amp; for the good of Gods Church. The Dragon not ſpoken of, hitherto, but in chap. 12, is now one with his ſubſtitute the Beaſt, and with the falſe prophet; they all ioyne in one, and ſend out their meſſengers.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. Here is ſhewed, what theſe frogges be,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1694:172"/> what they doe, to whom they goe, and wherefore.

                     <p>Verſ. 15. The certaintie of theſe things is heere ſet downe, and a watchfulnes commanded in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puritie vpon a conſideration of theſe daies, ſo full of calamitie. The inſerting of the words here, and interrupting of the courſe of the prophecie (as in Geneſ. 49. 18.) ſhew the greatnes of the danger, and the neceſſitie of this admonition to take heed before hand, as in a deſperate perill.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. Mention is made in verſ. 14 of God Almightie, and here is ſaid (alluding to Eſai. 24. 21. 22.) hee gathered them, whom the three vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirits went to gather; ſo as the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is at the Lords guiding, his prouidence ruleth, and his counſell ſhall ſtand. The place of this great battell is called <hi>Armageddon</hi> in Hebrew; not that there is ſuch a place, but ſo according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word, <hi>har,</hi> being a mountaine, and <hi>Megaddo</hi> the place of <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>And the ſeuenth Angell</hi> poured out his viall on the aire: The laſt degree of deſtruction

                     <p>Verſ. 18.

                     <p>Verſ. 19. The effect of theſe iudgements and this Earthquake vpon whom it ſhall fall, and who ſhall feele the ſame. The great Citie and Babylon here is one, for theſe words, <hi>and great Babylon came in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. is put expoſitiuely, ſhewing what is meant by the great Citie, (of which ſee chap. 17. 18.) and why ſuch a deſtruction now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the ſame, which had ſo long continued in great pompe and glorie. <hi>And the cities of the Nations:</hi> What is meant by nations, ſee chap. 11. 2, for the ſame there and here is all one. There is ſummarily ſet downe, what ſhall come to paſſe vnder the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth trumpet; of which here this, &amp; the reſt of the ſeuen vials are the parts, fully explaining what is there briefly noted. So then the <hi>cities of the nations,</hi> are all the places depending vpon, and containing the ſubiects of the great Citie; the deſtruction
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1694:173"/> whereof is their ouerthrow; it was diuided and they fell therwith, through that great Earthquake; theſe Nations and Antichriſtian Gentiles tread vnder foote the holy Citie, chap. 11. 2, but now are they themſelues troden downe, and rewarded for their wickednes.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And euery Iland fled away, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were not found:</hi> In the deſtruction of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Empire, they are ſaid to be moued out of their places, in chap. 6. 14: but here, to be no more at all. Hereby no other thing is meant, but as the great Citie periſheth, and the Cities of the nations; ſo alſo the Iles and mountaines, that is, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced places, and the ſtrongeſt places; in a word, all the whole dominion of Antichriſt ſhall vtterly periſh. There ſhall no where be any more footing vpon earth for the ſame; there ſhal not be an Iland to receiue it, nor mountaine to defend it. Thus ſhall the whole earth be purged cleane (one day) of this Pope and Papacie, and no where be found.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 21. Hauing ſpoken of the places, now hee ſheweth what ſhall become of the men. <hi>And there fell vpon men</hi> a great <hi>haile,</hi> an alluſion to <hi>Ioſua 10. 11, out of heauen;</hi> ſhewing hereby, that it is the Lord himſelfe that ſhall deſtroy theſe men, and fight for his people, as hee did for <hi>Ioſua</hi> and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites: <hi>Euery ſtone about the weight of a talent.</hi> In <hi>Ioſua,</hi> chap. 10, they are called <hi>great ſtones;</hi> but here is noted an incredible weight, only to ſhew, that, moſt deadly vengeance in a moſt incredible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (yet as certaine as <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth the weight of theſe ſtones) ſhall light vpon theſe men to deſtroy

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1694:175"/> wound receiued, by which being as dead, yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and recouering againe, then ſhould theſe words, <hi>was, is not, and yet is,</hi> be ſpoken of him; <hi>was,</hi> to wit, in the gouernment Eccleſiaſticall, by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops vpon the tranſlation of the Empire from Rome to Conſtantinople: <hi>and is not,</hi> by comming in of the Gothes and Vandals, bereauing Rome of inhabitants, ouerthrowing for a time, that eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall gouernment of Biſhops at Rome: <hi>And yet is,</hi> not being vtterly by the Gothes furie extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, the wound being finely healed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaſt, (cap. 13. 11. 13. 14.) who cunningly crept vp from Epiſcopall iuriſdiction, into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall ſtate and Empire, by his obtained ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie; and ſo obtaining great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was wondred at of them that dwelt on the earth, by beholding him, the beaſt that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>yet is: And ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> This is the beaſt, chap. 11. 7. which beginning is giuen vnto him, as he is in his recouered eſtate, and now exalted to the height, to an Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gouernment; for ſo conſidered is hee ſaid to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend out of the bottomleſſe pit: <hi>and ſhall goe into perdition:</hi> that is, it ſhall not be a permanent ſtate euer, but bee deſtroyed and vtterly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with him, as we ſee chap. 19. 20. <hi>and they that dwell on the earth ſhall wonder,</hi> as is alſo ſaid in chap. 13. 3. <hi>whoſe names, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the reprobates, which ſo ſhall wonder and worſhip the beaſt, cap. 13. 8. <hi>When they behold the beaſt that was,</hi> to wit, ſubſtituted by the Dragon; Rome being left by the Emperours, chap. 13. 3. <hi>and is not:</hi> being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                     <p>Verſ. 9. Hauing expounded the beaſt, ſhewing what he is; here he telleth vs, what is meant by the ſeuen heads which this beaſt hath: and of theſe heads he giueth a double interpretation; the one is heere, that they ſignifie ſeuen hilles, on which Rome ſtood, as I haue before ſhewed at large.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. The other interpretation is, <hi>and there are ſeuen Kings,</hi> ſo the beaſt is the whole ſtate, and the heads are the Prime gouernours of it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heree Kings, for their ſoueraignty and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regencie in that Citie; they are not the ſeuen ages of the world, as the Ieſuite <hi>Ribera</hi> dreameth. <hi>fiue are fallen,</hi> that is, the fiue heads that had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been. 1. <hi>Kings, 2. Conſuls, 3. Dictators, 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemuiri, 5. Tribuni militum:</hi> for the heads are ſo many differing kinds of gouernors in the Roman gouernment, and not ſo many ſingular perſons go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning; for then had this beaſt periſhed long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and not now haue been troubleſome to the Chriſtian world. <hi>Andone is,</hi> that is, the ſixth head, the Heathen Romane Emperors. <hi>And the other:</hi> that is, the ſeuenth, called an <hi>other,</hi> for his ſo much differing from all the reſt before him, when he ſhal come. Neither is it ſaid <hi>an other,</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſpake of one vncertaine, who he ſhould be; but <hi>the other</hi> (as it is well tranſlated), as if he ſaid, the beaſt already ſeene in the viſion, and ſhewed vnto mee,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1694:176"/> in verſ. 3. <hi>Is not yet come: Iohn</hi> ſaw not this other the ſeuenth, but onely in viſion. <hi>And when hee commeth, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace.</hi> It is not ſaid by way of limitation, he muſt continue <hi>but</hi> a ſhort ſpace, as if the time of this <hi>other the ſeuenth,</hi> ſhould be onely for a ſhort ſpace, and ſo periſh vtterly; which hath made ſome (ſo conceiuing of the words) to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand hereby the rule of the Gothes and Vandals at Rome, who had but a ſhort raigne, and periſhed vtterly. But there is a great difference of theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he muſt continue <hi>but</hi> a ſhort ſpace, and <hi>hee muſt continue a ſhort ſpace;</hi> the former implyeth neceſſarily a cutting off, after a ſhort ſpace, and to be no more; the latter not ſo, but ſheweth that hee hath a grant to bee, and that hee muſt haue a ſhort ſpace allotted vnto him to be; but not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inforcing vs to thinke, that therfore after that ſhort time, hee ſhould haue no being at all. It is therefore, as if the Angell had ſaid vnto <hi>Iohn, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> this ſeuenth head, which maketh the beaſt, which thou ſeeſt, which <hi>yet is not come,</hi> but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will come in his time; and when hee is come in the ſucceeding Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, vpon the tranſlation of the Empire from Rome, to Conſtantinople, (as our Soueraigne in his moſt learned Apologie ſpeaketh) <hi>he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace ſo,</hi> till hee receiue the deadly wound; and bee then as it were not, till the ſame againe be healed by the beaſt riſing out of the earth, and exerciſing all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, cap. 13. 11. 12.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And</hi> (So vpon this recouerie and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1694:177"/> beaſts great power) <hi>the beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> by this his ſo ſtrange riſing from Epiſcopall gouernment, by which hee was the ſeuenth head, into ſo high and ſupreme power, as altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from it, he ſeemed to become an <hi>other</hi> then before he was ſeene to be: <hi>euen he,</hi> (now in mans account) is the eighth King; for ſo the word <hi>eighth</hi> agreeth in gender with the word <hi>King,</hi> and not with the word <hi>beaſt. And is,</hi> (yet in deed and truth) <hi>of the ſeuen,</hi> that is, the ſeuenth; of which before more at large in the firſt part of this preparatiue, chap. 3. in the anſwere to the third obiection. <hi>And goeth into perdition,</hi> as is before ſaid, verſ. 8. this is his end, chap. 19. 20. Note heere, that the ſeuenth head, and eighth King in account, is that very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, chapt. 13. 11. obtaining onely of all the heads, to be called <hi>the beaſt,</hi> and ſo the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaſt, chap. 13. 1. 11. doe heere become both one. So then the Popedome (the firſt beaſt) beareth vp Rome; the woman and the Pope that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (the ſecond beaſt) maketh the Popedome, whoſe deſtruction ſhall bee the vtter ruine of all the Romane ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. The Angell hauing ſhewed, what the beaſt is and his heads; now hee commeth to his hornes, and telleth vs that they are ten Kings, but ſuch as in <hi>Iohns</hi> daies had receiued no kingdome: but afterwards when this Beaſt ſhould come, they then ſhould <hi>receiue power as Kings,</hi> that is, haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne and kingly regencie. For the hornes were crowned, chapt. 13. 1. Heereby therefore is meant abſolute and free Princes, and not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1694:177"/> powers, and Leiftenants, or Preſidents of Prouinces, as were vnder the ſixth heade, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, who would weare the crowns vpon his owne head, and not admit the hornes (as heere) to haue crowns, <hi>One houre,</hi> that is, in the ſpace of an houre, that is, in a very little ſhort time. <hi>With the beast,</hi> that is, with the ſtate of Rome vnder Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13, Whereupon theſe Kings ſhall be ſo vnited to the Beaſt, as all they can do, they will do for the ſame, and that with full conſent.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. Of the beaſts warre with the Saints, we haue heard before, chap. 11. 7. and 13. 7. Heere we ſee by whom he doth it, euen by theſe hornes, but (bleſſed be God) they loſe the victorie.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>The waters:</hi> on which it is ſaid, verſ. 1. that the woman ſitteth, are expounded to be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; for Antichriſts dominion ſhall largely extend it ſelfe, cap. 13. 7. and 11. 9.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 16. As the riſing vp, and proſperity of the Beaſt hath bin noted; ſo now the ruine and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. <hi>And the ten hornes:</hi> the very ſame which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with one mind gaue their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt, and which hornes <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw vpon the Beaſt. <hi>Theſe ſhall hate the whore:</hi> that is, the woman ſitting vpon the Beaſt (verſ. 3.) and the whore ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon many waters, (verſ. 1.) with whom theſe Kings committed fornication, which made alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drunke with the wine of her fornication, verſ. 2. but her ſelfe became drunke with the blood of Saints. verſ. 6. Their hate at length, conceiued iuſtly againſt her, ſhall bring Rome to vtter ruine.</p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:1694:178"/>
                     <p>Verſ. 17. A reaſon heere is giuen, both of the ſtrange alteration of the minds of theſe Kings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whore; as alſo how it was, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they affected ſo much the beaſt before. A hand of God was in both, vntill that which he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhould be fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 18. The Angell interpreteth the myſterie of the woman, and plainly ſheweth who ſhee is. <hi>The woman is the great City:</hi> myſtically called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> verſ. 5. but in deed and truth, <hi>Rome;</hi> which in <hi>Iohns</hi> dayes raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, as as I haue before proued out of the Euangeliſts and Acts of the Apoſtles in part, 1. chap. 3. and in the anſwere to the firſt obiection.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 22. There ſhall be no more pleaſurable delights, no more men of trade to liue there, no ſound of a milſtone, that is, no vſe thereof for food, for that there ſhall bee none dwelling in that place.</p>

The reaſon of their ioy here expreſſed, <hi>for he hath iudged.</hi> Theſe words ſhew what, is meant by iudgement in chap. 17. 1, euen Babylons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, ſet out in cap. 18. <hi>The great whore:</hi> Thus he calleth Babylon ſo iudged, as is ſhewed, in the former chapter. And it is euident by this, that the great Citie Rome is the woman, chap. 17. 18, the woman is the whore, chap. 17. 1. 4, this whore is Babylon, for vpon Babylons deſtruction the whore here is ſaid to be iudged.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. A doubling of their ioy againe, crying,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1694:181"/> 
                        <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> praiſe God. And <hi>her ſmoake roſe vp for euer and euer:</hi> Her eternall vengeance. The like words are in Eſai. 34. 10. An alluſion to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Zodome and Gomorrhe, Gen. 19.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. The former reioycing may ſeeme to be of all true Chriſtians, heere and there diſperſed abroad, when they ſhall heare of this deſtruction of Rome; but this verſe is of the publique aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie lauding and worſhipping God. Of the foure and twentie Elders and foure beaſts, ſee chap. 4.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And a voyce came out of the throne:</hi> The throne is Gods ſeate, here verſ. 4. and chap. 4. 2. The <hi>voyce</hi> is therefore from God, yet vttered by ſome of the Church, becauſe hee ſaith, Praiſe our God, &amp;c. It may bee ſome one of the beaſts (who are in the middeſt of the throne, chap. 4. 6.) which exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all of all ſorts to praiſe God.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. The effect of this exhortation, God was praiſed. And <hi>Iohn heard (as it were) the voyce of a great multitude, and as the voyce of many waters:</hi> becauſe this, great multitude was of people, nations, and tongues, chap. 17. 1. 15. chap. 7. 9. <hi>and as the voyce of a mightie thunder:</hi> Becauſe as thunder it was heard a farre of, and men made to attend thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. The Godly exhort one another to ioy, and to giue honour to God, for the now glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtate of the Church after the deſtruction of the Whore; <hi>For the marriage of the Lambe is come, and his wife hath made her ſelfe readie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It is hence cleere, that there ſhall be as great difference between the ſtate of Gods Church now, and that which is to come after Romes ruine, as betweene the time of honourable perſons only betrothed, and the high ioyfull and glorious day of their publike marrying; and as betweene the time of a King comming on to his kingdome, and his actual and powerfull reigning as King in deed.</p>

This is for the certaintie of the things which are to be written, as the laſt words of this verſe ſhew, being added as a reaſon of the commandement to write; not that there is any miſtaking of any other thing of all the reſt, either done or ſaid to <hi>Iohn</hi> before; or, that there is any more or greater truth in this here commanded to bee written, then in all the reſt: but for the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diblenes of the ſo glorious and moſt ioyfull eſtate of the Church, and their happineſſe alſo which ſhall be partakers thereof.</p>

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1694:182"/> at theſe words, more then at all the reſt, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie neceſſarily, that hee was exceedingly lifted vp with ſome ſudden ioy of ſome ſtrange and happie matter foretold here vnto him; which moued his hart to an extraordinary gladneſſe, &amp; himſelf thus to fall downe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did vpon his ioy concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of that, which was foretold him touching the birth of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 17. 17. Now what matter could ſo greatly rauiſh the heart of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as to heare of the calling of the Iewes? which in all probabilitie is the thing foretold; whoſe obſtinacie made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorrow of heart; and that he could haue wiſhed himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from Chriſt for their ſakes, Rom. 9. 2. 3. <hi>That haue the teſtimonie of Ieſus:</hi> That is, which be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and witneſſes of Chriſt hauing the ſpirit, that is, the gift of the ſpirit to prophecie and to beare witneſſe of Chriſt; for here the <hi>hauing of the teſtimonie of Ieſus</hi> is (in chap. 22. 9.) expounded by the word <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And I ſaw heauen opened.</hi> Before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle can follow on, to tell vs further of this Bride thus arraied, and of the Churches happie eſtate, he muſt firſt ſhew vs the maine lets yet hindring, and wholly to be taken out of the way; the lets are two, Antichriſt and the Dragon, both which are vtterly to bee confounded, before the perfection of the Churches gracefull ſtate. Of the firſt and his vtter damnation he ſpeaketh in this chapter; of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the next. For wee muſt know, that when Rome is deſtroyed, the Pope and his aiders ſhall liue for a while after, vntill the great battell ſpoken
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1694:183"/> of, chap. 16. 16, and the euent here (in verſes 18. 19. 20.) be ended: of this hee hath a moſt perfect vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, therefore it is ſaid, he ſaw <hi>Heauen opened,</hi> as did <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. 55, not a doore only, as in chap. 4. 1. <hi>Or,</hi> by <hi>Heauen opened,</hi> may be meant the open acceſſe vnto the Church euery where, and euery way, as being now apparent to all; in which Chriſt and his armies were readie to breake out vpon their deadly foes, gathering themſelues together againſt them, as is ſhewed, chap. 16. 14. 16, and here in ver. 19. Here is ſhewed, in what ſtate the Church ſhall be in, vpon the ruine of Rome; euen as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtanding in armes vnder their Generall Chriſt Ieſus for a time, till the laſt battell be fought, and the enemies deſtroyed. <hi>And behold:</hi> Spoken both for certaintie and alſo for matter needing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our carefull conſideration of ſo great troubles, as then ſhall be in the world, by open ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie and bloudie battels, betweene true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and the Antichriſtians. <hi>A white horſe:</hi> A <hi>horſe</hi> is a beaſt for warre; by this is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meanes to encounter the enemies. <hi>White</hi> noteth his righteouſneſſe in proceeding to warre, and in the triumph. <hi>And he that ſate vpon him was called faithfull and true, and in righteouſneſſe hee doth iudge and make warre:</hi> Theſe laſt words tell vs, why he hath a white horſe. This Rider is Ieſus Chriſt, as all the words here and after ſhew: <hi>faithfull,</hi> chap. 1. 5. and <hi>true,</hi> chap. 3. 7. 14: for his righteouſnes in iudgement, ſee Pſal. 9. 8. and 96. 10. 13.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. His eyes were as a flame of fire, ſo is Chriſt ſet out, chap. 1. 14. and 2. 18. <hi>And on his head
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1694:183"/> were many crownes:</hi> in cap. 1. 14. no mention of any crownes, then vpon his head, while his Church was to liue vnder croſſes and perſecutions, he was then bare headed: when ſhe crept from vnder An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt he put on one crowne, cap. 14. 14. but now many crownes. A <hi>crowne,</hi> noteth out victorie, <hi>many crownes,</hi> many victories, either gotten, or to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, now ouer all his enemies. <hi>Many crownes</hi> hee weareth, becauſe he taketh the crowns from Kings now, whom he conquereth, verſ. 19. and therefore is called King of kings. The Beaſt (the Pope) now ſhall weare no longer his triple crowne; for hee, and alſo his Kings ſhall periſh together: <hi>all nations:</hi> ſhall now doe worſhip to this King of Saints, cap. 15. 4. <hi>And he had a name written:</hi> to ſhew, that it was ſure and permanent. <hi>That no man knew but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> ſuch a name as <hi>Iehouah,</hi> not knowne to the Iſraelites, till <hi>Moſes</hi> came to deliuer them, Exod. 6. 3. but with his deedes hee declared his name; euen ſo here, Chriſt, while his people were in Egyptian bondage, his name <hi>written</hi> King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, verſ. 16. was actually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; but in this his maruellous worke of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering his people, in ſo ſtrange an ouerthrow of all his and their enemies, was made now manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And he was clothed in a veſture dipt in blood:</hi> A garment expreſſing the exceeding great ſlaughter of his enemies, and the abundance of blood-ſhead, in which (as it were) his veſture is dipped. The alluſion is to the words of Eſa. chap. 63. 2. 3. <hi>And his name is called the word of God.</hi> Of this title we may reade, Ioh. 1. 1. and Ioh. 5. 7. but I
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1694:184"/> take it, that here hee is ſo called, for that hee doth make good his fathers word, euery way fulfilling it; and obtaining grace from God to haue it fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, euen in euery thing whatſoeuer was threatned againſt the enemies of the Church, for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſake. By him are the promiſes to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple accompliſhed, the myſterie of God, chap. 10. 7. finiſhed; by him iuſt vengeance paſſeth vpon the Churches enemies, that ſo he may well bee called <hi>the word of God;</hi> as alſo that by him (now Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt being deſtroyed) the word of God at this time chiefly ſhall take place, by which he ſhall bee knowne, as by a name.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. Here are his ſouldiers, <hi>the armies in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> that is, of the true Church: <hi>followed him vpon white horſes; clothed in fine linnen, white and cleane:</hi> This their rayment is expounded in verſ. 8. The ſpirit of God ſetteth them out, not as going to battell, but as in triumph hauing obtained the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie; euen as alſo their captaine is ſet out. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rather ſetting the end of the battell before vs, that in conſideration thereof wee (the Church) might be comforted; then the warlike proceeding and bloody encounter, which without the certain knowledge of the iſſue, would worke nothing but feare and terrour in mens harts, which here is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. Here is ſhewed, how the righteous and ſtout warrior obtaineth the victory: <hi>Out of his mouth goeth a ſharpe ſword:</hi> of this there is mention, ca. 1. 16. &amp; 2. 12. 16. which is Gods word. <hi>that with it he ſhould ſmite the nations:</hi> That is, thoſe Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

The drift is, to ſet out the euident and cleere certainty of the victory, of which the Church ſhall be ſo aſſured, as if in the ſunne one ſtood to make proclamation thereof vnto vs. This Angell may type out ſuch, as by cleere light of truth ſhall make knowne the certaine deſtruction of the enemies, before the battell bee fought: the words in this 17. verſe, and in the next, verſ. 18. are an alluſion to Ezech. 39. 4. 17. 20. noting out the exceeding great ſlaughter, which ſhall be made of thoſe Antichriſtians of all ſorts.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>An Angell:</hi> Not that in the ninth chapter, verſ. 1. as is ſhewed there in verſ. 11. for as in this one thing, to wit, that both haue the key of the bottomleſſe pit, they doe agree; ſo in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, the circumſtances compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they doe greatly diſagree. This Angell is a type of ſome one or moe, (ſuch) inſtruments, as Chriſt did vſe to curbe the open rage of Satan and his inſtruments murthering the Saints. <hi>Came down from heauen:</hi> This telleth vs of what ſort this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is, receiuing his power and authority from out of heauen aboue, for, and in the behalfe of the heauen, the Church of God beneath. <hi>Hauing the key: Key</hi> is a ſigne of gouernment, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, Eſay 22. 22. which this Angell bringeth from heauen with him; but the ſtarre, chap. 9. 1. brought it not from heauen (from which hee fell) to the earth, but it was giuen to him. <hi>Of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit:</hi> I thinke this bottomleſſe pit, is that which in cap. 12. 13. is called the earth, into which the Dragon was caſt out of heauen. For of that time is this matter which is here handled, and the ſame Dragon ſpoken of. Of this pit ſee before, cap. 9. 1. 2. <hi>And a great chaine in his hand:</hi> A <hi>chaine</hi> is that, with which are bound ſuch as be kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Iudg. 16. 21. 2. King. 25. 7. hereby is noted the meanes of reſtraining this Dragon within this bottomleſſe pit, and it is ſaid to be <hi>great,</hi> for to ſet out the ſtrength of the means to hold in the great red Dragon; as hee is called in chap. 12. A great chaine for a great Dragon.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And hee laid hold on the Dragon:</hi> The
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1694:187"/> words imply a forcible ſtrength in apprehending of him, as in the battell between <hi>Michaell</hi> and him, chap. 12. 7. 9. The Dragon, the Serpent, the diuell and Satan, foure names, to ſet out the head of all the power of darkneſſe; ſo in chap. 12. 9. and hee ſheweth himſelfe powerful, to be ſuch a one agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all theſe in his inſtruments. <hi>And bound him a thouſand yeeres:</hi> The chaine is vſed, and therwith is he bound; that is, the Lords meanes are of force holding in (as it were) bound in a chaine, this great enemie within the pit; ſo as hee could not openly rage in bloody perſecutions, by his Ethnicke and Pagan inſtruments, as before hee had done: from this is he bound, in this reſpect is his reſtraint, for the ſpace of a <hi>thouſand yeeres.</hi> The beginning wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is (as ſome thinke) in the yeere 300. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great began to beare rule, and became the Chriſtian Emperour; and the ending was about the 1300. yeere, in the time of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth. This binding implyeth a liberty before, from which he is now reſtrained; now his liberty before was open rage and bloodie perſecution, as is ſhewed in chap. 6. and 12. and as may appeare by his practice, when hee getteth looſe againe, here in verſ. 8. 9. returning to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bloody rage, and murtherous diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints: therefore his binding this ſpace of a thouſand yeers, is a reſtraining of him ſo long from the open ſlaughtering of the Saints, (for elſe he is not bound ſimply one houre, Iob 1. 1. Pet. 5. 8.) but this was not before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his dayes. Againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeth the beginning of his binding
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1694:187"/> in viſion; therefore (according to a rule giuen in this preparatiue from cap, 4. 1. <hi>That, nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the original is ſhewed vnto Iohn, is to haue beginning before the time of this Reuelation</hi>) this binding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the time of the beginning of the preaching of the Goſpell; nor to take beginning in the time of Heathen Emperours, who bloodily in open furie raged againſt Chriſtians, from which onely here he is now ſhewed to bee bound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. The very act of this his binding, that is, of the reſtraint of his open and bloody ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints was begun, when he was caſt, cap. 12. 9. out of heauen, (that is) when his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (the Heathen tyrants) were by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> throwne from the Empire of Rome, the City then raigning ouer all, cap. 17. 18.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And caſt him into the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> that is, into the <hi>earth,</hi> ca. 12. 9. where, and vpon which, he muſt onely exerciſe his furie: and therefore is it ſaid, cap. 12. 12. woe to the inhabitants of the earth; but with the Church in open rage, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he now was not to meddle; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſame place the heauens are exhorted to reioyce. The <hi>Earth</hi> is the ſtate of the worldly ſort, to which the ſtarre fell, cap. 9. 1. and where he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming the beaſt, got by the Dragons helpe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, cap. 13. 8. ſo as all the world did follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, chap. 13. 3. This <hi>earth</hi> is the bottomleſſe pit, out of which the beaſt commeth, chap. 13. 11. and 17. 8. and 11. 7. when this Dragon was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, cap. 12. 9. for he (in the Heathen Emperours) no ſooner was caſt out of heauen into the earth,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1694:188"/> (being then not able longer openly to perſecute the Church) but began to worke for his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child that Antichriſt, to raiſe him out of the earth, in which among the earthly ſort, hee was chained vp, as in a priſon, as it is called heere in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſ. 7. for it is a priſon for Satan to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from publicke and violent rage, yea from any degree of miſchiefe againſt the Church. <hi>And ſhut him vp:</hi> that is, he was not ſuffered to goe beyond his limitts, but was kept within his bounds, as in a cloſe priſon-houſe: the phraſe is in Geneſ. 7. 16. but to another end and purpoſe. <hi>And ſealed,</hi> (to wit, the doore or ſtone) <hi>vpon him:</hi> An alluſion to Dan. 6. 17. to ſignifie, as there, ſo here, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was not to be changed. <hi>That he ſhould deceiue the nations no more:</hi> Theſe words ſhew the end of his reſtraint. By <hi>nations</hi> here is not meant the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Gentiles, in chap. 11. 2. 18. for theſe hee had liberty to deceiue, making the Beaſt ſpeake like him, chap. 13. 11. by which hee ſeduced the earth, verſ. 14. and did helpe to ſend out frogs, (thoſe vnclean ſpirits) from out of his own mouth, and out of the mouth of the Beaſt and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, chap. 16. 13. 14. But <hi>nations</hi> here muſt bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as in verſ. 8. here following, for the open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt; ſuch as was formerly the fierce ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of Rome, and all ſuch as profeſſe not Chriſt. <hi>His deceiuing of them,</hi> was to moue them to bloody outrages, and open hoſtility againſt the Church, as appeareth in the ſaid 8. verſe. For his deceiuing heere, in this time of his binding, muſt bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as his deceiuing is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at his looſing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1694:188"/> againe, from which here he is bound. So then the meaning is, that Satan ſhould not haue for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments the open enemies of Chriſt (in all this ſpace of a thouſand yeeres) to kill, murther, and to make warre vpon the Saints, the true worſhippers of God; though the earthly ſort ſhould neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bee plagued, and that with bloudſhed and ſlaughter: for albeit he was caſt out of heauen, yet with great wrath hee came vnto the inhabiters of the earth, (chap. 12. 12.) and the Turkiſh furie (in Gods iuſt iudgement) ſpared not the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, chap. 9. 18, from whom hee was not at all bound. <hi>Till the thouſand yeeres were fulfilled, and after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon,</hi> as is againe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in verſe 7.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. The Apoſtle telleth vs, what he ſaw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Satan was caſt into his priſon and there bound vp. This viſion is concerning the Church of Chriſt, that hidden number ſealed (chap. 7.) and ſtanding with Chriſt on Mount Sion, chap. 14. 1. <hi>And I ſaw:</hi> To wit, after the Dragons binding, <hi>thrones,</hi> that is, ſeates for Kings reigning with Chriſt. <hi>And they ſate vpon them:</hi> who is meant by <hi>they</hi> may be vnderſtood by conſidering the words following, and the laſt words of this verſe, euen they that had <hi>iudgement</hi> giuen vnto them, that is, the ſpirit of diſcerning betweene Chriſtianitie and Antichriſtianiſme, <hi>they liued and reigned with Chriſt thoſe thouſand yeeres. And I ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded:</hi> Among this reigning companie, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, that ſome of them ſhould bee found out by the Dragons ſubſtitute, the Beaſt that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1694:189"/> and by him be put to death. Firſt, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the truth, <hi>for the witneſſe of Ieſus, and for the word of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>for not worſhipping him the Beaſt, neither his image, &amp;c.</hi> By which words it is cleere, that the Beaſt in chap. 13, euen that Romane Antichriſt, is of great power, ruling mightily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of theſe thouſand yeeres; putting, as we here ſee, ſome of the faithfull to death, for vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the truth of Chriſt and his word, againſt his vſurped Antichriſtian power and authoritie. <hi>And they</hi> (that is, thoſe that ſate on the thrones, not they that were beheaded) <hi>liued and reigned with Chriſt thoſe thouſand yeeres.</hi> It is ſaid <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> ſhewing, that this was not ſeene to the world; their life and reigne here was not worldly and open to mens eyes, but ſpirituall and hidden. If thoſe that were beheaded liued not againe, ſome may heere aske; why are theſe words (<hi>they liued</hi>) added after, as if they had riſen from the dead to reigne with Chriſt here; for this life and reigne is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to bee here on earth? I anſwere, for that in ſome ſort, though not properly, thoſe that were ſlaine may be ſaid to liue and reigne; <hi>firſt,</hi> in reſpect that by their conſtant profeſſion and ſuffering, they ſtrengthened others in the faith to liue and reigne with Chriſt; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> for that (when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries had ſlaine them, and ſo thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be rid of them) the Lord raiſed vp others in their ſtead, to witneſſe the ſame truth againſt thoſe their enemies; in whom theſe ſlaine ones may be ſaid to liue againe, as <hi>Eliah</hi> did in the perſon of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> as Chriſt witneſſeth: and as did alſo
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1694:189"/> the two Prophets, of which before in chap. 11. 3. 7. 8. 11.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>But the reſt of the dead:</hi> That is, ſuch as were without the ſpirituall life of God, and ſo dead in the ſinnes and treſpaſſes of that Antichriſtian ſtate, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> was dead in <hi>Baal,</hi> Hoſea. 13. 1: and as the Church of Sardis was ſaid to be dead, chap. 3. 1, ſo theſe left, according to the appointed time of God, to be ſeduced by worſhipping of the Beaſt and his image, and by receiuing his marke alſo vpon their foreheads or hands, became dead to Godward; though as Sardis they were aliue in the iudgement of men. <hi>Liued not againe, till the thouſand yeeres were finiſhed:</hi> Theſe words implie that firſt they once liued, then were dead, and after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres were to liue againe, which cannot bee vnderſtood of the ſelfeſame perſons. But thus wee muſt conceiue of this ſpeech, that Antichriſt ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men from the true worſhip of God (in which reſpect men are ſaid to be aliue) vnto a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, (in which reſpect they are ſaid to be dead) and therein holding them for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres; God would at length, by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, call them out of this ſpirituall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as out of the graue, to liue in the light of the truth, which formerly had been forſaken. And here the text ſeemeth to ſpeake of the ſame perſons, (which yet cannot be) onely for that thefe laſt doe (through Gods mercy, after ſo long time) enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profeſſion of that truth &amp; true worſhip, which the firſt ſort did receiue, and the ſeduced did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1694:190"/> of that which is before ſpoken, concerning the power of the Goſpell preached, regaining vnto Chriſt his people from vnder Antichriſt, out of people, nations, and tongues, cap. 10. 11. and 14. 6. <hi>This is the firſt reſurrection,</hi> to wit, ſo to be inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the truth, as they come from popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and idolatrie, to the true and ſincere worſhip of God, ſhewing foorth the powerfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof in life and conuerſation.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 7. Here we are foretold, what ſhall happen at the end of a thouſand yeeres. <hi>Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon,</hi> the bottomleſſe pit before named, verſ. 3, that is, hee ſhall haue libertie to vſe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                     <p>Verſ. 8. This ſetteth foorth the Diuels laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt being let looſe. <hi>He ſhall goe out to deceiue,</hi> as he did before his binding, chap. 12. 9. <hi>the nations,</hi> that is, the open enemies of Chriſt, <hi>which are in the foure quarters of the earth,</hi> ſo it ſhall be the greateſt power that he can make. <hi>Goe and Magog:</hi> So are the nations called, which Satan hath here the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of.

After the gathering of the armie, the enterpriſe is here ſet downe, going and ſpreading themſelues, as a floud vpon the face of the earth, farre and wide; words of alluſion to Ezech. 38. 9. 16, and endeuouring that none of the faithfull ſhould eſcape them, they therefore compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tents of the Saints, as the Aramites did Dothan, 2.

Pſal. 21. 9. an alluſion either to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction of Zodom, Gen. 19, or to the deuouring vp of the proud Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with their fifties by fire, 2. King. 1. 10. 12.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 10. The finall concluſion of the laſt enemy here is ſhewed, after the deſtruction of his armie, the Diuels endleſſe damnation, with his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child Antichriſt, chap. 19. 20.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 11. From this verſe to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, as it were, a deſcription of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; firſt to ſhew, that from this laſt battell, in which the laſt enemies were ouerthrowne, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1694:191"/> caſt into hell, there ſhould bee peace to Gods Church vnto the comming of Chriſt vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of which peaceable and gracefull ſtate of the Church is ſpoken in the next chapter, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof vnto the end of the fifth verſe of the 22 chapter. But ſecondly, to giue vs another conſideration of the end of all ſorts of enemies to Gods Church: for the Spirit hauing giuen vs knowledge of two battels, with the iſſue of both, and of the deſtruction of the grand Captaines, chap. 19. 20. and here in this chap. verſ. 10; now for that it is not likely that all and euery one of their part were in the ſaid Armies, but that there were alſo many other which came not to the battels, here we are giuen to know, how the Lord procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt them; euen as a Iudge in a moſt holie and vpright courſe of iuſtice to reward them after their workes; and ſo to remoue from before his preſence, whatſoeuer might hinder the making of a new heauen and a new earth, of which he ſpeakes in the next chapter, and of the aboliſhing of an <hi>earth</hi> and an <hi>heauen</hi> in this verſe of this chapter. <hi>And I ſaw a great white throne:</hi> An alluſion to Dan. chap. 7. 9. 10. A <hi>throne</hi> is a ſeate of kingly maieſtie; <hi>white</hi> noteth puritie, and ſo vprightnes of that ſeate of iuſtice: <hi>great,</hi> as fit for ſo glorious and high a potentate as Chriſt is, Tit. 2. 13. Luk. 1. 32. <hi>And him that ſate on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Chriſt the Iudge of quick and dead, (Act. 10. 41.) who was brought foorth heere in this booke firſt ſtanding, in chap. 1, and in the time of the Churches troubles, chapter 8. 3, and 14. 1: but after the Church was ſomewhat recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1694:192"/> and heere now victoriouſly preuailing, hee is ſhewed here <hi>ſitting,</hi> and in chap. 14. 14. <hi>From whoſe face the earth and the heauen fled away:</hi> What this flying away is, the next words ſhew, <hi>and there was found no place for them,</hi> becauſe they are corrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and all ſhal become new, the 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5. verſes of the next Chapter doe expound this verſe.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead:</hi> Theſe be they that be brought before the Iudge, <hi>ſmall and great,</hi> that is, all without exception, <hi>ſtand before God,</hi> making now their appearance. <hi>And the bookes were opened:</hi> An alluſion to Dan. 7. 10. His proceeding is by cleere euidence in writing; the <hi>bookes</hi> here be the <hi>conſciences</hi> of men, which as open books, when men come to be iudged, ſhall ſhew what euery man is; theſe be the common books of all men, in and out of the Church, not ordained to be ſaued; for there is another booke for the elect, <hi>which is the booke of life;</hi> of which mention is made chap. 3. 5, and 13. 8. Luk. 10. 10. Exod. 32. 32. Phil. 4. 3. This booke here is opened, that Gods elect may be ſeene &amp; knowne. By the way note, that all things here thus ſet down are ſpoken according to men in iudiciall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, not that God either hath or needeth any ſuch booke. <hi>And the dead were iudged out of theſe things, which were written in the bookes,</hi> that is, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their workes.</hi> So theſe laſt words ſhew, what are thoſe written things in the bookes, euen mens workes.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 13. Here is ſhewed, whence all theſe dead appearing before God are fetched; from the <hi>ſea,</hi>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:1694:192"/> the <hi>graue,</hi> or place where <hi>death</hi> hath ſeaſed vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And death and hell were caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> where the diuell, the beaſt and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are, verſ. 10. The meaning I take to be onely this, that there ſhould bee a full end of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of all deadly meanes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that might hinder her gracefull and glorious ſtate, deſcribed in the Chapter following.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 15. And, to wit, for to know a concluſion of all reprobates, all ſuch inhabiters of the earth, that haue worſhipped the beaſt, chap. 13. 8. and haue holpen him to tread downe the holy Citie, cap. 11. 2. and merrily reioyced at the murthering of the faithfull witneſſes and Preachers of the truth, chap. 11. 10. <hi>Whoſoeuer was not found written in the booke of life, was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> In this deſcription of iudgement, mention is onely made of the dead, and of the reprobates, and of Chriſts proceeding to remoue them, as he did before their captaines and heads; which maketh me to thinke, that this heere is onely made mention of, to giue full comfort to the Church of her perfect deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from all and euery enemie, ſmall and great, and from all meanes of her future hurt and ruine, as is death and hell: that ſo, without any let or hindrance, ſhe may be that holy and heauenly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that bride adorned for her husband, to liue with him for euer.</p>

                     <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing told of the vaniſhing of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1694:193"/> the earth and heauen, in the former chapter, verſ. 11. heere hee ſheweth what enſued thereupon, all became new; <hi>a new heauen and a new earth:</hi> as in Eſa. chap. 65. 17. and 66. 22. <hi>for the firſt heauen, and the firſt earth were paſſed away,</hi> as in cap. 20. 11. is foretold. <hi>And there was no more ſea:</hi> that is, no more vnquietneſſe and troubleſome ſtate. The ſea cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt vp dirt and mire, Eſa. 57. 20. therefore may an vnquiet ſtate be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſea.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And Iohn ſaw the holy City:</hi> The ſame that was before troden vnder foot, chap. 11. 2. but now exalted on high from her former low ſtate, and obtaineth a new name, and is called the <hi>new Ieruſalem,</hi> the bride, and the Lambs wife, cap. 19. 7. and heereafter, verſ. 6. So all the company of the faithfull are compared to the City Ieruſalem; and to a bride to be a wife vnto Chriſt, <hi>comming downe from God out of heauen:</hi> This new Citie is the very hand of God, and his worke from aboue out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whence ſhe hath her birth, and which ſhe ſhal poſſeſſe for an euerlaſting inheritance. <hi>Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is of a moſt heauenly condition, ſhee is then prepared; and when ſhe is arayed in fine linnen, cleane and white, cap. 19. 8. ſhee is adorned, and a wife ready for her husband, the Lambe Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of heauen:</hi> as it were following this bride, this new Ieruſalem from heauen; to ſhew, that the matter here ſpoken of, was ſo indeed, and not a dreame, how ſtrange and incredible ſoeuer to mans reaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1694:193"/> a heauenly voice confirmeth it, <hi>ſaying, behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, &amp;c.</hi> chap. 7. 15. all the words taken out of Ezech. 37. 27. 28.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 4. God his dwelling with his people ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things happie to them, and remooueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſorrow with the cauſes thereof; heere is ſhewed, when that was to come to paſſe, which in the generall view of the Churches ſtate is ſet downe, in chap. 7. 16. 17. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes,</hi> (as he ſpeaketh in Eſa. 25. 8.) who before haue wailed and lamented, becauſe now they ſee, that God is reconciled to them, and become their God, and alſo come vnto them, which might ſeeme before to haue been forſaken; and that it might appeare how effectually the Lord would wipe away teares, it is ſaid, that <hi>there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be any more paine.</hi> That is, no more ſuch cauſes, meanes and inſtruments of death, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, crying, and paine, as formerly had been: of which happineſſe ſummarily before, in chap. 7. 16. 17. And the reaſon of all this is giuen, becauſe <hi>the former things are paſſed away,</hi> that is, the firſt earth, and heauen, and ſea, all the Dragons Empire, the Beaſts dominion, power and practice, the deceits of the falſe prophet, and whatſoeuer was before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny annoyance to the Church, and hurtfull to the quiet peace thereof: for now it may be ſaid of the Church, as in Eſa. 54. 14. and 60. 18. and 61. 3. 7. reade the places.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And</hi> for that theſe things here ſpoken ſeeme ſo impoſſible, and ſo hard to bee beleeued,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1694:194"/> 
                        <hi>he that ſate vpon the throne,</hi> that is, God Almighty, chap. 20. 11. 12. and one that cannot lie, <hi>ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I make all things new:</hi> a new heauen, a new earth, all things new. And that what here he hath ſpoken might be taken for certaine truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded to <hi>write</hi> them, with this reaſon, that theſe words are true and faithfull; and therefore to be aſſuredly fulfilled in their time, though men ſhould hold them falſe, and not worthie credit.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>And he ſaid vnto me, it is done:</hi> So in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech. 39. 8. Behold it is come, it is done ſaith the Lord God, this is the day whereof I haue ſpoken. The <hi>myſtery of God ſpoken of,</hi> in chap. 10. 7. now was finiſhed, and that in two things, wherein the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling did conſiſt: <hi>The one</hi> in taking full vengeance vpon all the enemies of Chriſt and his Church, at the pouring out of the ſeuenth viall, the laſt of the laſt ſeuen plagues; and therefore it was there ſaid, <hi>it is done,</hi> cap. 16. 17. <hi>The other,</hi> in bringing the Church into ſo glorious and happie eſtate, as is heere ſet downe; and therefore now alſo againe it is ſaid, <hi>it is done. I am Alpha and Omega:</hi> that is, the beginning and the end; this here foretold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is of me; I begin it, I finiſh it: for of mee, by me, and for me, are all things, Rom. 11. 36. The Lord is the firſt and the laſt, Eſa. 44. 6. &amp; 48. 12. he hath wrought and done it, Eſa. 41. 4. Now for that the Lord knew, that ſuch happie and excellent things as here are ſpoken of, and ſo certainly to be fulfilled, would worke in the hearts of the faithfull, a vehement deſire for the accompliſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he here promiſeth in a figuratiue ſpeech to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1694:194"/> their thirſt, to the full; to <hi>giue to ſuch a one as is athirst,</hi> ardently inflamed in his affection after theſe things, <hi>of the fountaine of the water of life,</hi> chap. 7. 17. and that ſuch a one ſhall partake of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ſpirit, Ioh. 7. 38. 39. and that <hi>freely</hi> of his ſole mercie and good fauour towards him.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 7. Here, leſt men ſhould thinke a feruent deſire to be enough, to aſſure them of that which is heere foretold and promiſed, the Lord telleth them of a victorie which they muſt get, ſaying, <hi>hee that ouercommeth ſhall inherit all things.</hi> Concluding with the words of the Couenant made of old with his people, <hi>I will be his God, and he ſhall bee my ſonne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>But</hi> (as if he had ſaid) what here I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerneth nothing the vngodly, of which, for example ſake, I will name ſome, the <hi>fearfull and vnbeleeuing and abominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and lyars,</hi> they ſhall not enioy any part or portion of this new heauen and earth, <hi>but ſhall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> the place of the diuell, the beaſt and falſe prophet, chap. 19. 20. and 20. 10. <hi>which is the ſecond death,</hi> ſeparation from God for euer.</p>
                     <p>Verſ. 9. Now that it might appeare, that no ſuch filthie perſons can come into this heauenly Citie, (as is noted alſo in verſ. 27. of this chapter) and to ſhew the Lords ſeruants more at large what this new Ieruſalem is, before mentioned, for whoſe ſake he would make all things new, heere is a moſt full and perfect deſcription giuen therof, which <hi>Iohn</hi> is made to behold, the ſame being

                     <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>And the City lieth foure ſquare:</hi> becauſe it is moſt firme and ſtable without any tottering and moueable ſtate, and becauſe it looketh euery way to the foure corners of the earth; by the gates to receiue in vnto it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all parts of the earth. <hi>And the length is as large as the breadth:</hi> As this hath compaſſe and is ſpread abroad, ſo hath it like length and full continuance without alteration. <hi>And hee,</hi> that is, the Angell, verſ. 9. 15. <hi>meaſured the Citie with a reed:</hi> as he had a reed for the purpoſe, ſo hee applieth it to the worke, and findeth it by true meaſure to he 12000. furlongs, eight furlongs being a mile, it is 1500. miles. Now the length and the breadth, and the heighth being equall, it maketh this to be wonderfull incredible; but all is to ſet out vnto vs, how abundantly capable this City is to entertaine the innumerable multitude, which ſhall come vnto it.</p>

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:1694:197"/> and length muſt bee iudged by the heighth and length of the Citie, elſe it could not compaſſe the Citie, nor be high enough for ſo high a City; and neceſſity requireth that there bee an anſwerable thickneſſe to ſo long and high a wall, that it may be ſtrong and defenſible for the Citie; nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſhake it or pierce it through. The length and ſpaciouſneſſe of the City is for capableneſſe of in-commers, the height is for the manifold and goodly manſions, the thickneſſe of the wall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing round the ſame with anſwerable height, giueth vs the inuincible ſtrength of the City, and the ſecurity of the inhabitants. <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing told vs of the meaſuring of the wall, he in the laſt place ſheweth, vnto vs, what kinde of meaſuring here is meant, <hi>the meaſure of a man;</hi> that is, (ſaith he) <hi>of an Angell,</hi> that is, ſo a mans meaſure, as it is alſo the Angels meaſure.</p>

Now the Prophet meant not in comforting the Church then, that they ſhould haue no more light of Sunne and Moone: for liuing in the world, they ſo ſhould haue liued in perpetuall darkneſſe, and not haue enioyed the common bleſſings of this life; from which meaning the Prophet was farre, ſeeing the Lord created Sunne and Moone for mans vſe, which therefore hee would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue his owne people of. But the light of the Sun and Moone is put for earthly and fading comforts of this life, as the reſt of the words of the Prophet in the ſame verſes ſhew; for inſtead of the light of Sunne and Moone, which is not euer, he oppoſeth the Lord the euerlaſting light, and ſo concludeth, that the dayes of mourning ſhall bee ended. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this their comfort by the Lord, ſhall not bee like the light of the Sunne and Moone, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſeth away, or is often darkened: Therefore here by the <hi>not needing the light of Sunne and Moone,</hi> (the glory of God and the Lambe <hi>being the light of it</hi>) is meant, that ſuch ſolace and ioy, ſuch glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart and heauenly comfort this City ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Lord, and in his glorious preſence, as all earthly comfort, though it were as the light of the Sunne by day, and as the light of the Moone by night, ſhould bee as ſuperfluous and needleſſe and of no reſpect in compariſon of it.</p>

Pſal. 45. 4. <hi>proceeding out of the throne,</hi> (that is, the head of the riuer) <hi>of God and of the Lambe:</hi> for the Lambe is in the middeſt of the throne, chapt. 5. 6. the waters flow out from the Temple and Altar, Ezech. 47. 1. but here being no Temple, chap. 21. 22. and ſo no Altar, but God and the Lambe in the roome thereof; therefore this water commeth from his throne, of which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made, as in many places of this prophecie, ſo in cap. 4. where it is ſet in heauen, verſ. 2. but there proceeded out of it, lightenings, thunders, and voices, verſ. 5. but here only water of life.</p>

Hitherto is the deſcription of the moſt gracefull and glorious eſtate of the Church of Chriſt, which may rauiſh the hearts of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1694:200"/> all that reade it, to ſay with the Lords people, verſe 20, Come Lord Ieſus.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning this ſo holie a Citie and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate of the Church, I finde two opinions: the one, <hi>that here is ſet out the Church triumphant in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, after the reſurrection at the laſt day:</hi> the other, <hi>that here ſo is to be vnderſtood the Church triumphant, as yet neuertheleſſe withall, is foreſhewed ſuch a moſt happie condition, as in ſome ſort to befall the Church of Chriſt here on earth, after the happie conuerſion of the Iewes;</hi> whoſe embracing of the Goſpell, ſhall be as life and riches to the Chriſtian world, Rom. 11. 12. 15; and in compariſon of which time wee are yet, but as in a kinde of liueleſſe ſtate and poore condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The reaſons for the opinion fetched from the text are theſe: I. Becauſe this Citie is ſaid to come downe from God, cap. 21. verſ. 2; and not to aſcend vp, or to be taken vp vnto God, as the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, at the laſt day ſhall be, 1. Theſſ. 4. 17. Chriſt will come to take the Church vp to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Ioh. 14. 3. it ſhall not come downe after the laſt iudgement to remaine here. II. Becauſe ſhe is ſaid to bee prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband, verſ. 2. Now the Church triumphant of all the elect gathered together, is not a Bride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, but a wife in mariage fully accompliſhed. III. Becauſe it is called a Tabernacle, a remouing ſtate, and God alſo ſaid to be <hi>with men,</hi> and <hi>to dwell,</hi> as in a Tabernacle, <hi>with them.</hi> Concerning the Church triumphant, the manner of ſpeaking is to ſay, <hi>that it is with God.</hi> IV. Becauſe the holy Ghoſt ſo ſtrongly confirmeth this renouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al things,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1694:200"/> auouching it againe and againe, verſ. 1. 5, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to write it, and affirming the words to be faithfull and true: which needed not in ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall approued and beleeued truth, touching the ſtate of the Church triumphant. V. Becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> is made to aſcend high vp, to ſee this new City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him deſcending out of heauen from God. VI. Becauſe it is ſaid to bee meaſured, and that with the meaſure of a man, ver. 16. 17; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to bee the Church militant, which is onely meaſurable, and to be meaſured, chap. 11. 1. Zach. 1. 16, but not the triumphant. VII. Becauſe here is ſaid, that nations ſhall <hi>walke in the light of it;</hi> and Kings of the earth bring their glorie and honour vnto it, verſ. 24, yea, the glorie and honour of the Nations to it, verſ. 26. But can any bring earthly glorie and honour (for of ſuch glorie and honour hee ſpeaketh) vnto heauen aboue, to beautifie it withall? VIII. This opinion ſeemeth not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnreaſonable, albeit ſome things ſpoken after the letter, carrie our thoughts to a ſtate of full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, chap. 21. 4. and 22. 3. 4. 5; for that the like ſpeeches are vttered by the holy Prophets afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to ſet out the gracefull and peaceable ſtate of the Church, Eſai. 65. 17. 18. 19. 25. and 60. 18. 20. and 25. 8. and 60. 21. IX. Becauſe ſome ſuch like thing is promiſed to the Iewes, in the books of the Prophets, not yet hitherto, as may ſeeme, fulfilled; but deferred till the ſeuenth trumpet bee blowne, when the myſterie of God ſhall be finiſhed, as <hi>hath been declared to his ſeruants the Prophets,</hi> chap. 10. 7. By which words it is cleere, that all things in the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1694:201"/> Prophets are not accompliſhed, till this booke of the Reuelation bee fulfilled; for the Prophets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly haue ſpoken of this myſterie to be finiſhed vnder the ſeuenth trumpet.</p>
                     <p>Now that wee may not wonder at the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem here ſet foorth, looke vnto the prophecies of old, and marke what by them the Lord did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto the Iewes after their captiuitie. I. He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, they ſhall bee brought backe againe to Ieruſalem, and to inhabite Iudea, Zach. 8. 7. 8. and 10. 8. 9. Eſai. 60. 10. 15. and 62. 10: and this ſhall the Lord doe, who will cauſe righteouſneſſe and praiſe before all nations, Eſai. 61. 11. II. Hee will poure vpon them the ſpirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they ſhall looke vpon him whom they haue pierced, and they ſhall mourne for him, &amp;c. Zach. 12. 10. 14. III. He will make them ſtrong to ouerthrow all their enemies, and they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite Ieruſalem againe, Zach. 12. 6, and build the old waſts; they ſhall raiſe vp the former deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they ſhall repaire the waſte Cities, and the deſolations of many generations, Eſai. 61. 4. and 58. 12. and that by the helpe of ſtrangers and their Kings, Eſai. 60. 10. IV. Being ſo built, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it had been forſaken and hated, ſo as no man went thorough it, he will make it an eternall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and a ioy of many generations, Eſai. 60. 15. For firſt, violence ſhall no more bee heard in the land, waſting nor deſtruction within the borders, but her walls ſhall bee called ſaluation, and her gates praiſe, Eſai. 60. 18: the Sunne ſhall be no more her light by day, neither for brightnes ſhall
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1694:201"/> the Moone giue light vnto her, &amp;c. Eſai. 60. 18. 19. 20. Secondly, all the people ſhall bee righteous, Eſai. 60. 21, and no Canaanite there, Zach. 14. 21. Thirdly, her officers ſhall be officers of peace, and her Exactours, righteouſnes, Eſai. 60. 17. Fourthly, her watchmen ſhall neuer be ſilent, Eſai. 62. 6, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer be wanting, Eſai. 59. 21: but the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and vncleane ſpirits ſhall be cut off, Zach. 13. 2: ſo as by this glorious and gracefull ſtate ſhe ſhall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord ſhall name, Eſai. 62. 2, that is, <hi>Hephzi-bah,</hi> and the land <hi>Beulah,</hi> for the Lord would delight in her and marrie her; <hi>or Iehouah-there,</hi> ſhall be the name of that Citie, Ezech. 48. 35. V. Hereupon they ſhall be knowne among the Gentiles, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all that ſee their ſeede and ofſpring, ſhall acknowledge them the ſeede which the Lord hath bleſſed, Eſai. 61. 9, a holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, ſought out and not forſaken, Eſai. 62. 12. VI. The Gentiles and their Kings ſhall ſee her righteouſneſſe and glorie, Eſai. 62. 2: whereupon they ſhall come to her, Eſai. 60. 3, and that with earneſt deſire and high eſtimation of her, Zach. 8. 22. 23, and be ioyned to the Lord, and become his people alſo with her, Zach. 2. 11. Theſe Nations and Kings ſhall bring to her ſonnes &amp; daughters, Eſai. 60. 4. and 49. 22, inrich her mightily with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and precious things, Eſai. 60. 6. 17. ſhe ſhall eate the riches of the Gentiles, Eſai. 61. 6, and ſucke the milke of the Gentiles, and the breaſts of Kings, Eſai. 60, 16, who ſhal be her nurſing fathers, and the Queenes her nurſing mothers, Eſai. 49. 23,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1694:202"/> bringing her preſents and gifts, Eſai. 60. 6. and 45. 14. They ſhall fall downe and make ſupplication, Eſai. 45. 14: they ſhall worſhip with their faces to the earth, and licke the duſt of her feete, Eſa. 49. 23. Zach. 14. 16. Strangers ſhall be her ſeruants, Eſai. 61. 5: yea ſuch as will not ſerue her, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, Eſai. 60. 12. Zach. 14. 17. She ſhall bee a crowne of glorie in the hand of the Lord, and a royall Diademe in the hand of her God, Eſai. 62. 3. And this her excellencie ſhall neuer bee changed, her daies of mourning ſhall be ended, Eſai. 60. 19. 20, her ioy euerlaſting, Eſai. 61. 7. for euer ſhall her land be inherited, Eſai. 60. 21. Zach. 14. 11: for to the Lord is ſhe married, Eſai. 62. 4, who ſweareth by his right hand, and the arme of his ſtrength, to giue her no more ouer to her enemies. Eſai. 62. 8. At that day the Lord ſhall bee King ouer all the earth, and in that day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name One, Zach. 14. 9. Thus wee ſee, what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious promiſes are made to that people; which, whether alreadie fulfilled, or yet to be expected, and in this prophecie here foretold, I leaue to the godly, wiſe, and learned to iudge of, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Whatſoeuer is hereby to bee vnderſtood, (whether only the Church glorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant after the reſurrection; or a peaceable and gracefull ſtate of the Church militant, for a time, after her enemies are deſtroyed, and the ancient people of God called) the Angell which ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth him, <hi>that theſe ſayings are faithfull and true,</hi> verſ. 6. Therefore let vs beleeue, pray, and expect the accompliſhment of the words of this
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1694:202"/> bleſſed prophecie: The reſt of the words from verſe 6 to the end are not difficult, and therefore here I end this preparatiue. Thou O Lord which teſtifieſt theſe things, ſaiſt, Surely I come quickly, Amen, euen ſo come Lord Ieſus.</p>
