    _ THE FIRST PART.

      * CHAP. I.

THE OBIECTIONS THAT MAY be made to hinder the ſtudie of this booke.

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

II. Obiect. I thinke it is granted, indeed, that BabylonRome Heathen, and not Chriſten, is Babylon. is put for Rome, but ſo it must bee vnderſtood, as it then was Rome, heathen, being a bloody Citie by the perſecution of thoſe tyrannicall Emperours, and not as it is Rome Christen, vnder the holy Father, the Biſhop of Rome.

III. Obiect. If this bee ſo, as me thinke you doe make it moſt apparent, then of neceſsitie ſhould the Pope be that Antichriſt; for all learned Catholikes acknowledge that here he is to be found, euen that great Antichriſt, which they doe looke for to come: but you cannot proue the holy father the Pope to be Antichriſt.

THE TRVE LIKENES AND FVLL agreement of the Pope and this beast, ſhewing them to bee one and the ſame in ſubstance.

Obiect. It is deliuered in ſtrange and obſcure figures, as no true meaning can be gathered thereof.The tropes and figures are not vnuſuall.

Obiect. If God would haue had it knowne, Iohn would not haue penned it in ſuch a darke manner as it is.

Obiect. The matter of this booke is obſcure and hard to be conceiued.

Obiect. Oh but (will ſome ſay) there is ſuch diſagreement among expoſitors, euen in things that may be thought to be past, as well as in thoſe things yet hereafter to be fulfilled, as we cannot but held it a booke too obſcure to be medled with.

Obiect. Laſtly, it may be demanded, if it may bee vnderſtood now, why was it not better vnderſtood of the ancient fathers, who were learned men, and liued ſo neere the time of the Apoſtle himſelfe? ſurely it may bee
held, if they vnderſtood it •ot, as many doe now ſay, let not men at this day thinke themſelues, ſo wiſe, ſo learned and ſo h••y, as that they can now vnderſtand it better then thoſe ſo renowned men before them.

Obiect. But it is well knowne that not one or two, or few men, but very many, and thoſe alſo perſons of note, which ſpeake of the obſcuritie of this booke, and do as much, as lieth in them, to withhold men from the ſtudie of it hereby.

Obiect. Belike you make all cleere, as if there were nothing in it darke and hard to be vnderstood.

Obiect. But may ſome ſay, becauſe the Pope hath not preuailed againſt vs, can it be made a generall rule for a teſtimonie of the decaying of his whole ſtate? and for that wee haue, and doe preuaile, therefore ſhall alſo the whole Church of Chriſt preuaile with vs in other places? what is this nation, that hence ſhould be made ſuch a concluſion?

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

THE OBIECTIONS THAT MAY be made to hinder the ſtudie of this booke.

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

II. Obiect. I thinke it is granted, indeed, that BabylonRome Heathen, and not Chriſten, is Babylon. is put for Rome, but ſo it must bee vnderſtood, as it then was Rome, heathen, being a bloody Citie by the perſecution of thoſe tyrannicall Emperours, and not as it is Rome Christen, vnder the holy Father, the Biſhop of Rome.

III. Obiect. If this bee ſo, as me thinke you doe make it moſt apparent, then of neceſsitie ſhould the Pope be that Antichriſt; for all learned Catholikes acknowledge that here he is to be found, euen that great Antichriſt, which they doe looke for to come: but you cannot proue the holy father the Pope to be Antichriſt.

Obiect. It is deliuered in ſtrange and obſcure figures, as no true meaning can be gathered thereof.The tropes and figures are not vnuſuall.

Obiect. If God would haue had it knowne, Iohn would not haue penned it in ſuch a darke manner as it is.

Obiect. The matter of this booke is obſcure and hard to be conceiued.

Obiect. Oh but (will ſome ſay) there is ſuch diſagreement among expoſitors, euen in things that may be thought to be past, as well as in thoſe things yet hereafter to be fulfilled, as we cannot but held it a booke too obſcure to be medled with.

Obiect. Laſtly, it may be demanded, if it may bee vnderſtood now, why was it not better vnderſtood of the ancient fathers, who were learned men, and liued ſo neere the time of the Apoſtle himſelfe? ſurely it may bee
held, if they vnderſtood it •ot, as many doe now ſay, let not men at this day thinke themſelues, ſo wiſe, ſo learned and ſo h••y, as that they can now vnderſtand it better then thoſe ſo renowned men before them.

Obiect. But it is well knowne that not one or two, or few men, but very many, and thoſe alſo perſons of note, which ſpeake of the obſcuritie of this booke, and do as much, as lieth in them, to withhold men from the ſtudie of it hereby.

THE OBIECTIONS THAT MAY be made to hinder the ſtudie of this booke.

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

II. Obiect. I thinke it is granted, indeed, that BabylonRome Heathen, and not Chriſten, is Babylon. is put for Rome, but ſo it must bee vnderſtood, as it then was Rome, heathen, being a bloody Citie by the perſecution of thoſe tyrannicall Emperours, and not as it is Rome Christen, vnder the holy Father, the Biſhop of Rome.

III. Obiect. If this bee ſo, as me thinke you doe make it moſt apparent, then of neceſsitie ſhould the Pope be that Antichriſt; for all learned Catholikes acknowledge that here he is to be found, euen that great Antichriſt, which they doe looke for to come: but you cannot proue the holy father the Pope to be Antichriſt.

THE TRVE LIKENES AND FVLL agreement of the Pope and this beast, ſhewing them to bee one and the ſame in ſubstance.

Obiect. It is deliuered in ſtrange and obſcure figures, as no true meaning can be gathered thereof.The tropes and figures are not vnuſuall.

Obiect. If God would haue had it knowne, Iohn would not haue penned it in ſuch a darke manner as it is.

Obiect. The matter of this booke is obſcure and hard to be conceiued.

Obiect. Oh but (will ſome ſay) there is ſuch diſagreement among expoſitors, euen in things that may be thought to be past, as well as in thoſe things yet hereafter to be fulfilled, as we cannot but held it a booke too obſcure to be medled with.

Obiect. Laſtly, it may be demanded, if it may bee vnderſtood now, why was it not better vnderſtood of the ancient fathers, who were learned men, and liued ſo neere the time of the Apoſtle himſelfe? ſurely it may bee
held, if they vnderſtood it •ot, as many doe now ſay, let not men at this day thinke themſelues, ſo wiſe, ſo learned and ſo h••y, as that they can now vnderſtand it better then thoſe ſo renowned men before them.

Obiect. But it is well knowne that not one or two, or few men, but very many, and thoſe alſo perſons of note, which ſpeake of the obſcuritie of this booke, and do as much, as lieth in them, to withhold men from the ſtudie of it hereby.

Obiect. Belike you make all cleere, as if there were nothing in it darke and hard to be vnderstood.

But may ſome ſay, becauſe the Pope hath not preuailed againſt vs, can it be made a generall rule for a teſtimonie of the decaying of his whole ſtate? and for that wee haue, and doe preuaile, therefore ſhall alſo the whole Church of Chriſt preuaile with vs in other places? what is this nation, that hence ſhould be made ſuch a concluſion?

      * CHAP. I.

THE OBIECTIONS THAT MAY be made to hinder the ſtudie of this booke.

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

II. Obiect. I thinke it is granted, indeed, that BabylonRome Heathen, and not Chriſten, is Babylon. is put for Rome, but ſo it must bee vnderſtood, as it then was Rome, heathen, being a bloody Citie by the perſecution of thoſe tyrannicall Emperours, and not as it is Rome Christen, vnder the holy Father, the Biſhop of Rome.

III. Obiect. If this bee ſo, as me thinke you doe make it moſt apparent, then of neceſsitie ſhould the Pope be that Antichriſt; for all learned Catholikes acknowledge that here he is to be found, euen that great Antichriſt, which they doe looke for to come: but you cannot proue the holy father the Pope to be Antichriſt.

THE TRVE LIKENES AND FVLL agreement of the Pope and this beast, ſhewing them to bee one and the ſame in ſubstance.

Obiect. It is deliuered in ſtrange and obſcure figures, as no true meaning can be gathered thereof.The tropes and figures are not vnuſuall.

Obiect. If God would haue had it knowne, Iohn would not haue penned it in ſuch a darke manner as it is.

Obiect. The matter of this booke is obſcure and hard to be conceiued.

Obiect. Oh but (will ſome ſay) there is ſuch diſagreement among expoſitors, euen in things that may be thought to be past, as well as in thoſe things yet hereafter to be fulfilled, as we cannot but held it a booke too obſcure to be medled with.

Obiect. Laſtly, it may be demanded, if it may bee vnderſtood now, why was it not better vnderſtood of the ancient fathers, who were learned men, and liued ſo neere the time of the Apoſtle himſelfe? ſurely it may bee
held, if they vnderſtood it •ot, as many doe now ſay, let not men at this day thinke themſelues, ſo wiſe, ſo learned and ſo h••y, as that they can now vnderſtand it better then thoſe ſo renowned men before them.

Obiect. But it is well knowne that not one or two, or few men, but very many, and thoſe alſo perſons of note, which ſpeake of the obſcuritie of this booke, and do as much, as lieth in them, to withhold men from the ſtudie of it hereby.

Obiect. Belike you make all cleere, as if there were nothing in it darke and hard to be vnderstood.

Obiect. But may ſome ſay, becauſe the Pope hath not preuailed againſt vs, can it be made a generall rule for a teſtimonie of the decaying of his whole ſtate? and for that wee haue, and doe preuaile, therefore ſhall alſo the whole Church of Chriſt preuaile with vs in other places? what is this nation, that hence ſhould be made ſuch a concluſion?

      * CHAP. IV.

THE OBIECTIONS THAT MAY be made to hinder the ſtudie of this booke.

I. Obiect. You in theſe oppoſitions do take for granted,By Babylon is not meant Rome. that by Babylon is meant Rome; which if it were ſo, who would not come out of her, ſeeing the Lord ſo plainly commandeth it, cap. 18. 4? but it cannot bee proued, that by Babylon is meant Rome.

II. Obiect. I thinke it is granted, indeed, that BabylonRome Heathen, and not Chriſten, is Babylon. is put for Rome, but ſo it must bee vnderſtood, as it then was Rome, heathen, being a bloody Citie by the perſecution of thoſe tyrannicall Emperours, and not as it is Rome Christen, vnder the holy Father, the Biſhop of Rome.

III. Obiect. If this bee ſo, as me thinke you doe make it moſt apparent, then of neceſsitie ſhould the Pope be that Antichriſt; for all learned Catholikes acknowledge that here he is to be found, euen that great Antichriſt, which they doe looke for to come: but you cannot proue the holy father the Pope to be Antichriſt.

THE TRVE LIKENES AND FVLL agreement of the Pope and this beast, ſhewing them to bee one and the ſame in ſubstance.

Obiect. It is deliuered in ſtrange and obſcure figures, as no true meaning can be gathered thereof.The tropes and figures are not vnuſuall.

Obiect. If God would haue had it knowne, Iohn would not haue penned it in ſuch a darke manner as it is.

Obiect. The matter of this booke is obſcure and hard to be conceiued.

Obiect. Oh but (will ſome ſay) there is ſuch diſagreement among expoſitors, euen in things that may be thought to be past, as well as in thoſe things yet hereafter to be fulfilled, as we cannot but held it a booke too obſcure to be medled with.

Obiect. Laſtly, it may be demanded, if it may bee vnderſtood now, why was it not better vnderſtood of the ancient fathers, who were learned men, and liued ſo neere the time of the Apoſtle himſelfe? ſurely it may bee
held, if they vnderſtood it •ot, as many doe now ſay, let not men at this day thinke themſelues, ſo wiſe, ſo learned and ſo h••y, as that they can now vnderſtand it better then thoſe ſo renowned men before them.

Obiect. But it is well knowne that not one or two, or few men, but very many, and thoſe alſo perſons of note, which ſpeake of the obſcuritie of this booke, and do as much, as lieth in them, to withhold men from the ſtudie of it hereby.

Obiect. Belike you make all cleere, as if there were nothing in it darke and hard to be vnderstood.

Obiect. But may ſome ſay, becauſe the Pope hath not preuailed againſt vs, can it be made a generall rule for a teſtimonie of the decaying of his whole ſtate? and for that wee haue, and doe preuaile, therefore ſhall alſo the whole Church of Chriſt preuaile with vs in other places? what is this nation, that hence ſhould be made ſuch a concluſion?
